Having both a Product Owner and a Technical Leader allows us to balance the user-targeted view with the implementation perspective. Despite of having those two roles assigned, everyone is welcome to help (e.g. Community Shepherd helps with the daily communication with our users).","sidebar":"autogenerated"},"weekly-roles/index":{"id":"weekly-roles/index","title":"Weekly roles of the Packit team","description":"Sharing responsibility in a team","sidebar":"autogenerated"}}}')}}]);
