The checks for the\\n  test job will also contain the name of the actual test distro\\n  (and not the build target as previously).\\n- A new option, `srpm_build_deps`, in the packit configuration file  \\n  can be used. Which is a list of RPM dependencies that are needed for\\n  the actions to be run when building SRPM and is an indicator to build\\n  the SRPMs in Copr.\\n\\n## Week 9 (March 1st - March 7th)\\n\\n- When a specfile is being generated, and both `specfile_path` and\\n  `downstream_package_name` are not set, Packit now correctly resolves this\\n  situation and sets `specfile_path` to the name of the upstream repo suffixed\\n  with `\\".spec\\"`.\\n  ([packit#1499](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1499))\\n- A new command `packit source-git status` has been introduced for checking\\n  the synchronization of a source-git and a dist-git repository based on the\\n  used git trailers. The command outputs a range of commits which need to be\\n  synchronized from dist-git to source-git or the other way around. If possible,\\n  the command also provides instructions on how to synchronize the repositories.\\n  ([packit#1500](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1500))\\n- We have added a new `enable_net` configuration option for Copr builds that\\n  allows you to disable network access during Copr builds. It is also complemented\\n  by `--enable-net`/`--disable-net` CLI options if you use Packit locally.\\n  ([packit#1504](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1504))\\n- Packit now adds \ud83d\udc40 instead of \ud83d\udc4d as a reaction to `/packit command`\\n  ([packit-service#1372](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1372))\\n- Progress of propose-downstream is now saved in the database and is available\\n  via API. Visualization in the dashboard is to follow next week, stay tuned.\\n  ([packit-service#1292](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1292))\\n- When running tests for the pull-request job, we now expose environment\\n  variables for commit hash, branch and URL both for pull-request source and\\n  target. In the test environment, you can use the following variables:\\n  `PACKIT_SOURCE_SHA`, `PACKIT_TARGET_SHA`, `PACKIT_SOURCE_BRANCH`,\\n  `PACKIT_TARGET_BRANCH`, `PACKIT_SOURCE_URL` and `PACKIT_TARGET_URL`.\\n  These variables are not set for test runs of releases and branch pushes.\\n  ([packit-service#1382](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1382))\\n\\n## Week 10 (March 8th - March 14th)\\n\\n- You can view information about ongoing propose-downstream jobs via our dashboard.\\n  ([dashboard#168](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/168))\\n- We have switched the cache for dist-git branches and Copr targets to TTL cache\\n  that gets discarded once in 12 hours, in case there is a change in targets, the\\n  changes shall propagate to both of our deployments without the need to redeploy\\n  within 12 hours. ([packit#1513](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1513))\\n- Packit now comments when it fails to find Copr project specified in the config.\\n  ([packit#1395](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1395))\\n- Packit now reacts to dist-git pushes to either `rawhide` or `main` when configured\\n  to do Koji builds for `rawhide`.\\n  ([packit#1393](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1393))\\n- You can specify an identifier for your job to be able to configure one job multiple times.\\n  For example, you can build multiple projects from one repository (known as monorepo concept)\\n  or try multiple build options. Using identifiers allows Packit to avoid naming collisions\\n  in commit statuses and default Copr project names.\\n  ([packit-service#1385](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1385))\\n- Packit no longer provides a misleading comment when it fails to update a set of\\n  targets on its own Copr projects.\\n  ([packit-service#1397](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1397))\\n\\n## Week 11 (March 15th - March 21st)\\n\\n- When using Packit CLI for creating Bodhi updates,\\n  you can now set `fas_username` and `fas_password` in your Packit user config\\n  to not be asked about that when the command is executed.\\n  Also, this allows Packit GitHub application to use this as well\\n  so you can look forward to Bodhi updates created by Packit\\n  (will be announced and described in a dedicated post).\\n  ([packit#1517](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1517))\\n\\n## Week 12 (March 22nd - March 28th)\\n\\n- We have updated contact information to `Packit <hello@packit.dev>`.\\n  ([packit-service#1410](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1410))\\n- Interactions with Bodhi should be now more reliable when creating Bodhi updates.\\n  ([packit#1528](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1528))\\n- Packit will no longer error out when trying to create a new Copr repository\\n  when it is already present.\\n  ([packit#1527](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1527))\\n- There is a new `packit_instances` key that you can use to specify the Packit\\n  instances you want to use for working on your jobs. Nothing will change for our\\n  production users, but users of our stage instance need to use this key to\\n  preserve the support of the stage instance -- they can set both stg and prod in\\n  the `packit_instances` list to use both, or use just one. Just be careful with\\n  the downstream jobs where both instances work with the same services.\\n  This new option works like other Packit options so you can set it on the top\\n  level and/or (re)define it on the job level.\\n  More information about our staging instance can be found here:\\n  [packit#1530](https://github.com/packit/packit/discussions/1530).\\n  ([packit#1417](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1417))\\n\\n## Week 13 (March 29th - April 4th)\\n\\n- We have implemented `get_contributors` function in ogr that can be used for getting contributors to the project on GitHub (set of logins) and GitLab (set of authors).\\n  ([ogr#692](https://github.com/packit/ogr/pull/692))\\n- When multiple propose downstream attempts for the same PR fail, the error messages are sent to to the same issue (as comments), instead of creating multiple new issues.\\n  ([packit#1427](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1427))\\n- Downstream synchronization of the Packit configuration file (aka `packit.yaml`) is now working properly again.\\n  ([packit#1532](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1532))\\n- `packit source-git update-dist-git` and `packit source-git update-source-git` now check the synchronization of source-git and dist-git repositories prior to doing the update. If the update can\'t be done, for example, because the histories have diverged, the command provides instructions on how to synchronize the repositories.\\n  A `--force` option is available to try to update the destination repository anyway.\\n  ([packit#1534](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1534))\\n- When using `post_upstream_clone` to generate your spec-file,\\n  Packit now correctly checks out a release before the action is run.\\n  ([packit#1542](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1542))\\n\\n## Week 14 (April 5th - April 11th)\\n\\n- We have introduced two new build and test target aliases: `fedora-latest-stable` resolves to the latest stable Fedora\\n  Linux release, while `fedora-branched` resolves to all branched releases (all Fedora Linux release, except `rawhide`).\\n  ([packit#1546](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1546))\\n- We have reverted the functionality of Packit that allowed you to have set **only** specific targets for Copr repositories.\\n  This functionality was introduced a while ago and was found to be not very beneficial in cases of differently\\n  configured Copr jobs building in parallel in the same Copr repository. This is an implementation detail in the end,\\n  but Copr project chroots are now only added and never subtracted\\n  (every build has precisely specified targets based on the copr_build job definition).\\n  ([packit#1551](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1551))\\n- If you are using our stage instance, we make it listen only on `/packit-stg` comment commands so you can now differentiate\\n  between the instances when commanding Packit via pull-request or issue comments.\\n  For the production instance, you can continue using `/packit` prefix as you are used to.\\n  ([packit-service#1432](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1432))\\n- A new configuration option `downstream_branch_name` has been added, which is meant to be used in source-git projects\\n  and allows users to customize the name of the branch in dist-git which corresponds to the current source-git branch.\\n  ([packit#1555](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1555))\\n- `revision-range` argument of the source-git `update-source-git` command is now optional. If not specified,\\n  dist-git commits with no counterpart in source-git are synchronized.\\n  ([packit#1547](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1547))\\n\\n## Week 15 (April 12th - April 14th)\\n\\n- We have implemented reporting of status for the propose-downstream job which means that you can now\\n  see the progress of the job via check runs/commit statuses on the particular release commits.\\n  ([packit-service#1435](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1435))\\n\\n## Week 16 (April 19th - April 25th)\\n\\n- The bug in our service about not setting GitHub and Gitlab statuses in case of lack of permissions was fixed.\\n  ([packit/packit-service#1457](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1457))\\n- Packit\'s CLI `source-git update-*` commands now check whether the target repository is pristine and in case not raise an error.\\n  ([packit/packit#1562](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1562))\\n\\n## Week 17 (April 26th - May 2th)\\n\\n- We have fixed an issue affecting Pipelines view on Dashboard. Currently you should be able to see pipelines again; we are also working on fixing empty rows for `propose-downstream` jobs.\\n  ([packit-service#1461](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1461))\\n- Packit now shows the specific info when it does not have permissions to create a Bodhi update of your package.\\n  When you configure `issue_repository` in your Packit config file, Packit will create an issue in that project and link the dist-git page where you can give _Packit FAS user_ the correct permissions.\\n  ([packit-service#1465](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1465))\\n- Packit now exports `PACKIT_PR_ID` environment variable to the Testing Farm.\\n  ([packit-service#1467](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1467))\\n- The bug in the Copr permission request is now fixed. (After the release of a new Copr client, Packit didn\'t catch that permission problem and didn\'t request the permissions to build in a custom Copr project.)\\n  ([packit-service#1472](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1472))\\n- We have fixed a bug that caused Packit to fail when submitting Testing Farm on `commit` trigger.\\n  ([packit-service#1474](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1472))\\n- Packit now builds RPMs in Copr triggered by `release` event with correct NVR (without the artificial release suffix). You can use it for distributing RPM packages via Copr.  \\n  ([packit-service#1478](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1478))\\n- From the security perspective, we have decided to disable the `create_pr` option for our service, from now on Packit will unconditionally create PRs when running `propose-downstream`.\\n  We have also updated the `propose-downstream` CLI such that it is possible to use `create_pr` from configuration **or** override it via `--pr/--no-pr` options.\\n  ([packit#1563](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1563))\\n- Packit now supports `release_suffix` configuration option that allows you to override the long release string provided by Packit that is used to ensure correct ordering and uniqueness of RPMs built in Copr.\\n  ([packit#1568](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1568))\\n\\n## Week 18 (May 3rd - May 9th)\\n\\n- `packit source-git` commands learnt to replace [Git-trailers in commit messages](https://packit.dev/source-git/work-with-source-git/control-patch-generation/) if they already exist. ([packit#1577](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1577))\\n- When initializing source-git repos, the author of downstream commits created from patch files which are not in a git-am format is set to the original author of the patch-file in dist-git, instead of using the locally configured Git author. ([packit#1575](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1575))\\n- Packit now correctly inform users about downstream errors only on the last try. (Previously, Packit informed for all tries even the last try succeded.) ([packit-service#1485](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1485))\\n- Dashboard now also shows propose-downstream jobs in pipelines view. We have also merged all jobs to one column to minimize dead space on the page. ([dashboard#178](https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/178))\\n\\n## Week 19 (May 10th - May 16th)\\n\\n- Metadata dictionary is no longer required when specifying a job. Keys which used to belong to the yaml metadata dictionary are now keys of the job dictionary itself. ([packit#1569](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1569))\\n- Packit now correctly removes patches during `packit source-git init` when the preamble does not contain blank lines. ([packit#1582](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1582))\\n- Packit now supports `--release-suffix` parameter in all of the related CLI commands. Also we have added a support for the `release_suffix` option from configuration to the CLI. With regards to that we have introduced a new CLI switch `--default-release-suffix` that allows you to override the configuration option to Packit-generated default option that ensures correct NVR ordering of the RPMs. ([packit#1586](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1586))\\n- Resolved an SRPM build problem caused by a new version of git that refuses to fetch in a git repo when it\'s owned on the OS level by someone else. ([packit#1497](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1497))\\n- Packit now passes `PACKIT_COPR_PROJECT` and `PACKIT_COPR_RPMS` variables to the Testing Farm. `PACKIT_COPR_PROJECT` holds Copr project in format owner/project and `PACKIT_COPR_RPMS` space-separated RPMs that were built in Copr. ([packit-service#1486](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1486))\\n- Packit now builds only its own dist-git commits. Other commits are not being acted upon. For reasoning, see [packit-service#1490](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/1490). ([packit-service#1498](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1498))\\n- We have automated our allowlisting process via a new Packit comment command `/packit verify-fas`. You can find more info in [our requirements](https://packit.dev/docs/guide/#2-approval). ([packit-service#1487](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1487))\\n\\n## Week 20 (May 17th - May 23rd)\\n\\n- We have fixed an issue with the handling of messages from Copr on release builds, which has resulted in not setting the correct statuses on commits. ([packit-service#1513](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1513))\\n- When doing an automatic FAS account verification, Packit now suggests the URL where the GitHub account needs to be set. ([packit-service#1508](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1508))\\n\\n## Week 21 (May 24th - May 30th)\\n\\n- Packit will not raise an exception anymore when creating a SRPM with dangling symlinks. ([packit#1592](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1592))\\n- You can now override which dist-git commits will be built in Koji by specifying FAS accounts of authors and committers using\\n  `allowed_pr_authors` or `allowed_committers` in the job metadata (see [the documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#koji_build)). ([packit-service#1520](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1520))\\n\\n## Week 22 (May 31st - June 6th)\\n\\n- Packit shows basic information about allowlisting in the status description\\n  when your namespace is not allowed.\\n  ([packit-service#1533](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1533))\\n\\n## Week 23 (June 7th - June 13th)\\n\\n- The creation of Bodhi updates should not time out anymore, because we no longer get the latest build of a package via Bodhi.\\n  ([packit#1612](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1612))\\n- We have fixed a regression where string values for the `targets` and `dist_git_branches` configuration keys were not accepted.\\n  ([packit#1608](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1608))\\n- We improved the reporting for the test job if we are not able to find any FMF metadata and the `skip_build` option is enabled.\\n  ([packit-service#1539](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1539))\\n\\n## Week 24 (June 14th - June 21st)\\n\\n- Git ref name that Packit works with during `propose-downstream` is now made more obvious in logs.\\n  ([packit#1626](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1626))\\n- Packit now correctly handles creation of custom archives in root while a specfile is in a subdirectory.\\n  ([packit#1622](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1622))\\n- There is a new check for git projects that are allowed to use a custom Copr project.\\n  There will be a better integration in the form of a new config field in Copr settings that Packit can use.\\n  In the meantime, the mapping is defined and maintained by the Packit team.\\n  Let us know if you need a project to be allowed.\\n  ([packit-service#1556](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1556))\\n- A link to Copr build logs was updated: it now points to a place where logs are available once a build starts.\\n  ([packit-service#1554](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1554))\\n\\n## Week 25 (June 21st - June 27th)\\n\\n- Packit Bash completion file is no longer needlessly executable. ([packit#1634](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1634))\\n- Packit now works with Bodhi 5 and Bodhi 6 authentication mechanism. ([packit#1629](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1629))\\n- Git ref name that Packit works with during `propose-downstream` is now made more obvious in logs.

It aimed to be an alias when Packit supported just one build type.\\n  There are currently more types of builds and just `build` can be misleading. Please, be explicit and use `copr_build` instead.\\n  The `production_build` name for upstream Koji build is misleading because it is not used to run production/non-scratch\\n  builds and because it can be confused with the `koji_build` job that is triggered for dist-git commits.\\n  (The `koji_build` job can trigger both scratch and non-scratch/production builds.)\\n  To be explicit, use `upstream_koji_build` for builds triggered in upstream and `koji_build` for builds triggered in downstream.\\n  Users will get a neutral status describing the change when the old names are in use. The status will become a warning\\n  starting in November and the old names will be removed by the end of the year.

([packit#1772](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1772))\\n- When packit.yaml is present in the repo but is empty, Packit now produces a better error message instead of an internal Python exception. ([packit#1769](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1769))\\n- Retriggering of tests when there is a build job and a test job with an identifier configured was fixed. ([packit-service#1731](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1731))\\n- Packit GitHub app will not modify a package version when `release_suffix` configuration option is empty. ([packit-service#1738](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1738))\\n- Our `specfile` parser now supports localized tags (e.g. `Summary(fr)`) and tags with qualifiers (e.g. `Requires(post)`). ([specfile#132](https://github.com/packit/specfile/pull/132))\\n- SRPM build logs are now deleted after 30 days instead of 90 days.

([packit-service#1757](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1757))\\n\\n## Week 47 (November 22nd \u2013 November 28th)\\n\\n- We have changed the limit for our [SLO1](https://packit.dev/docs/service-level-objectives/#slo1-changes-to-github-prs-receive-a-status-update-within-15-seconds-in-99-of-cases): it was increased from 15s to 30s to account for setting all statuses. ([packit-service#1776](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1776))\\n- The job names deprecated in October (`build` alias of `copr_build` and `production_build` replaced by `upstream_koji_build`) newly lead to an error state (was `neutral` ) of the deprecated status created by Packit.\\n  The old names will be removed by the end of the year. ([packit-service#1777](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1777))\\n- The Copr build logs URL now points to logs that are available even while building. ([packit-service#1767](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1767))\\n- Fixed an issue that caused empty lines originally inside changelog entries to appear at the end.

It is also possible to access the data directly, avoiding the `with`\\n  statement, by using the `content` property (e.g. `Specfile.tags().content`), but\\n  be aware that no modifications done to such data will be preserved.

We\'re planning to improve the user\\n  experience when using pipelines with easier navigation and filtering\\n  options.\\n- Building the latest development versions of\\n  [packit](https://github.com/packit/packit) and\\n  [ogr](https://github.com/packit/ogr) was moved to the\\n  [packit/packit-dev](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/packit/packit-dev/)\\n  Copr repo.\\n\\n## Week 40 (October 4th - October 8th)\\n\\n- [A bug](https://github.com/packit/packit/issues/1255) in Packit causing\\n  issues with local build when the branch was named with prefix `rpm` has been\\n  fixed.\\n- To fulfill requests regarding updating targets on Copr repositories, Packit\\n  Service will sync targets for the projects created by Packit Service (e.g.\\n  pull requests, or non-set Copr repository for releases and branch builds)\\n  and for Copr repositories **not owned by Packit** will try to extend the\\n  list if necessary.\\n- If you trigger packit jobs with one of `/packit _` commands, our bot gives\\n  you a \ud83d\udc4d reaction to let you know that we are working on it.\\n- Rerunning of failed tasks via GitHub Checks interface is now supported. You are now free to click those \\"Re-run\\" links.\\n- [ogr documentation](https://packit.github.io/ogr/) is converted to\\n  Google-style docstrings.

([packit#1402](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1402))\\n- The \\"Congratulations!\\" comment no longer has a disclaimer about our intentions to stop posting it by default. We have already made that move earlier this year, so the disclaimer is no longer relevant. ([packit-service#1260](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1260))\\n- Deprecated configuration options `current_version_command` and `create_tarball_command` have been removed and are no longer supported.

This will cause no Copr build to be built and\\n  installed into the testing environment, but only trigger the tests in\\n  Testing Farm (the selected components to be installed should be part of the\\n  TMT definitions).\\n  ([packit-service#1256](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1256))\\n- Packit supports `changelog-entry` action that is used when creating SRPM.\\n  The action is supposed to generate whole changelog entry (including `- ` at\\n  the start of the lines) and has a priority over any other way we modify the\\n  changelog with. ([packit#1367](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1367))\\n\\n## Week 46 (November 15th - November 19th)\\n\\n- A new `env` config option has been added for specifying environment variables,\\n  which are then passed to Testing Farm along with some more pre-defined\\n  variables (e.g. name of the project, URL, etc).\\n  ([packit#1411](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1411))\\n  ([packit-service#1275](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1275))\\n- The GitHub check run names are now shorter and easier to read.\\n  ([packit-service#1281](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1281))\\n\\n## Week 47 (November 22th - November 26th)\\n\\n- You can set up a new `koji_build` job using the commit trigger to submit a\\n  Koji build for a new commit in a dist-git branch.

([packit#950](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/950))\\n- [Anchit] fixed and enhanced the `/api/srpm-builds` endpoint.\\n  ([packit-service#788](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/788))\\n\\n[tomas]: https://github.com/TomasTomecek\\n[anchit]: https://github.com/IceWreck\\n\\n## Week 36 (August 31th - September 4th)\\n\\n- We store the submission time of SRPM builds now ([packit-service#795](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/795) by [Anchit]).\\n- [Shreyas] improved implementation of the build status reporting ([packit-service#740](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/740)).\\n- [Anchit] enhanced the `/koji-builds` endpoint to be more consistent with `/copr-builds` endpoint ([packit-service#791](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/791)).\\n\\n[anchit]: https://github.com/IceWreck\\n[shreyas]: https://github.com/shreyaspapi\\n\\n## Week 37 (September 7th - September 11th)\\n\\n- Stage now uses [Tokman](https://github.com/packit/tokman) to get access tokens for GitHub, which should resolve race condition when running parallel jobs\\n  (Tokman by [Hunor], ogr integration by [Matej]).\\n- [Franta] has addressed problems with Testing-Farm cluster with custom response on PRs that links to more information ([pinned info](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/803), [packit-service#798](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/798)).\\n\\n[hunor]: https://github.com/csomh\\n[matej]: https://github.com/mfocko\\n[franta]: https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek\\n\\n## Week 38 (September 14th - September 18th)\\n\\n- The combination of the source-git patches with existing patches now works well\\n  ([packit#963](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/963)).\\n- Service now mostly supports also GitLab as you can see\\n  [here](https://gitlab.com/packit-service/hello-world/-/merge_requests/10)\\n  or [here](https://gitlab.com/packit-service/src/drpm/-/merge_requests/2).\\n  A lot of small issues were fixed in the last week\\n  ([packit-service#806](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/806),\\n  [packit-service#812](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/812),\\n  [packit-service#814](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/814),\\n  [packit-service#815](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/815),\\n  [packit-service#816](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/816)\\n  ).\\n- Created Copr projects are now prefixed with the hostname\\n  for non-GitHub services and also support multipart namespaces\\n  ([packit-service#819](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/819)).\\n- [Laura] fixed two testing-farm related issues\\n  ([packit-service#808](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/808),\\n  [packit-service#809](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/809)).\\n  You can now use `test` job also on Pagure and GitLab thanks to that.\\n\\n[laura]: https://github.com/lbarcziova\\n\\n## Week 39 (September 21st - September 25th)\\n\\n- Packit-service can be configured to work with private namespaces. This is plumbing work which we need right now for CentOS Stream. We are not planning to enable this for GitHub - packit-service will still work only for public repositories, private ones are ignored. [packit-service#831](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/831)\\n- If git tag contains more information than just version (e.g. `pkg_name-v1.2.3`), it is possible to use upstream_tag_template to extract version from the tag, which will be used in a subsequent task. [doc](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#upstream_tag_template) [packit#959](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/959)\\n- Added support for globbing pattern in upstream_ref. [doc](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#upstream_ref) [packit#960](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/960)\\n- Packit `--remote` is global option now and available for all commands. Because of this `sync-from-downstream --remote` was renamed to `--remote-to-push`. Remote can now be specified in the user\'s config (via upstream_git_remote parameter). [packit#977](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/977)\\n\\nFollowing bugs were fixed:\\n\\n- Packit dropping leading zeros in version. [packit#814](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/814)\\n- Packit CLI issue caused by picking incorrect copr project name. [packit#971](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/971)\\n\\n## Week 40 (September 28th - October 2nd)\\n\\n- Packit-service is now explicitly checking if requested copr-build targets exist and if not, the user is informed about it. [packit-service#835](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/835)\\n- We have improved the way how packit updates `%setup` line in a spec file - you are now able to set content of `-n` option via archive_root_dir_template config option, it defaults to `{upstream-pkg-name}`. [doc](https://github.com/packit/packit.dev/pull/167) [packit#834](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/834)\\n- Packit is able to generate a patch file with format-patch without leading a/ and b/ in the patch diff. Required for patches in dist-git which are applied with -p0.\\n- Contribution guidelines were updated, now we have one shared [link](https://github.com/packit/contributing).\\n\\n## Week 41 (October 5th - October 9th)\\n\\n- [franta] made triggering of jobs more reliable and in correct situations ([packit-service#837](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/837))\\n\\n[franta]: https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek\\n\\n## Week 42 (October 12th - October 16th)\\n\\nNothing significant happened during this week. The only change was that Hunor\\n[resolved](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/850) a problem when sentry client library ([the alert service](https://sentry.io/) we use) caused errors in stage\\nenvironment and hence the problem didn\'t make it to production.\\n\\nWe have also released a new version of packit: [0.18](https://github.com/packit/packit/releases/tag/0.18.0).\\n\\n## Week 43 (October 19th - October 24th)\\n\\nWe finally had a week with plenty updates!\\n\\n- We found out the hard way that one cannot build in [Fedora koji](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/) directly\\n  from SRPM unless it\'s a scratch build. The discussion with Fedora rel-eng is\\n  happening at [pagure.io/releng/issue/9801](https://pagure.io/releng/issue/9801) and in the meantime, all koji builds\\n  will be halted on our side since we know they cannot succeed. Do `scratch: true` for koji builds before this gets resolved.\\n- Packit creates a symlink for a generated archive at the root of the project.\\n  So far it only did it from a relative path and now absolute paths are\\n  supported as well. This is useful when your specfile is placed in a\\n  subdirectory and rpmbuild can\'t find the archive.\\n- There is a new usability improvement to proposing a new downstream update. If\\n  the PR is already created, packit won\'t create it again. You will no longer\\n  receive duplicate downstream PRs in dist-git.\\n- When doing a new downstream update, packit doesn\'t sync %changelog since\\n  those are usually out of sync between upstream and downstream. Packit creates\\n  a new entry for the new release in the downstream. There is a new packit.yaml\\n  configuration option `sync_changelog` which bypasses this behaviour and\\n  copies the %changelog from upstream and overwrites the downstream changelog.\\n  Please use this option only when your changelogs are in sync. [Documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#sync_changelog)\\n\\n## Week 44 (October 26th - October 30th)\\n\\nNo user-facing changes in packit(-service) this week.\\n\\n## Week 45 (November 2nd - November 6th)\\n\\n- [Laura] implemented an option for packit to copy description from a release into\\n  a changelog when running `propose-update`. Also the default message has been changed\\n  to the list of commit messages from last release. ([packit#1004](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1004))\\n- [Jano] improved handling of build targets in packit. ([packit#986](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/986))\\n- [Tomas] improved an experience of a contributor to source-git in case the contributor\\n  doesn\'t follow git-am patches style that is used. ([packit#1000](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1000))\\n\\n## Week 46 (November 9th - November 13th)\\n\\n- [Tomas] improved the UX of logging in the CLI. ([packit#1014](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1014))\\n- [Jano] improved logic of acquiring current version in the CLI. ([packit#1013](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1013))\\n- We appreciate getting feedback from our users, if you could find some time to\\n  do so, there is an [open issue](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/859)\\n  for it.\\n\\n## Week 47 (November 16th - November 20th)\\n\\n- ~~[Matej] fixed [an\\n  issue](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/774) with Packit CLI,\\n  enabling recursive search for spec-files\\n  ([packit#1005](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1005)).~~ It turned\\n  out, this change made it very easy to [deplete GitHub API quota], so it was\\n  reverted.\\n- [Laura] made Copr builds to be part of the default jobs. This will cause\\n  build jobs to explicitly run, and display their own result flags in PRs,\\n  next to the test results. We hope this to be a more friendly behaviour for\\n  our new users ([packit#1024](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1024)).\\n\\n## Week 48 (November 23rd - November 27th)\\n\\n- [Laura] [fixed a bug], where Packit Service failed to trigger Copr builds\\n  before triggering the tests in case triggering Copr builds was configured\\n  for a different event.\\n- Thanks to [Matej], Packit Service will now [comment on commits] in case Copr\\n  builds fail after a merge, in order to indicate the reason for the failure.\\n- Packit Service will soon stop commenting on PRs after the first successful\\n  build. The installation instructions from these comments [were moved to the\\n  result page] by [Laura], while [Matej] [added a warning] to inform users\\n  about this upcoming change.\\n\\n[laura]: https://github.com/lbarcziova\\n[jano]: https://github.com/sakalosj\\n[tomas]: https://github.com/TomasTomecek\\n[matej]: https://github.com/mfocko\\n[deplete github api quota]: https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/876\\n[fixed a bug]: https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/888\\n[comment on commits]: https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/854\\n[added a warning]: https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/891\\n[were moved to the result page]: https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/877\\n\\n## Week 49 (November 30th - December 4th)\\n\\n- [Jano] fixed a bug in `sync_release` method of Packit API. ([packit#1043](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1043))\\n- [Jiri Konecny] contributed a fix for how Packit creates COPR urls. ([packit#1039](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1039))\\n- [Laura] updated instructions how to retrigger a job. ([packit-service#892](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/892))\\n\\n[jano]: https://github.com/sakalosj\\n[jiri konecny]: https://github.com/jkonecny12\\n[laura]: https://github.com/lbarcziova\\n\\n## Week 50 (December 7th - December 11th)\\n\\n- [Tomas] implemented the `--upstream-url` option of `packit init` command. When specified,\\n  `init` also sets up a source-git repository next to creating a configuration file.\\n\\n[tomas]: https://github.com/TomasTomecek\\n\\n## Week 51 (December 14th - December 18th)\\n\\n- Congratulations comments are now disabled by default, unless enabled in config.\\n- A bug, which prevented npm to be run during SRPM build, has been fixed.

(2019-03-19)\\n\\nOur sprint nears an end which means we have released [a new version of packit -\\n0.2.0](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/releases/tag/0.2.0)! You can\\nexpect a new release after every sprint (i.e. every 2 weeks).\\n\\nThe 0.2.0 version has a bunch of new features and improvements: you can find\\na complete list [in the\\nchangelog](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#020).\\nWe also have a [detailed\\ndocumentation](https://github.com/packit-service/packit#workflows-covered-by-packit)\\nfor all the workflows packit covers.\\n\\nLet\'s get through what\'s new:\\n\\n1. We have decided to rename two keys in our config file so they are more\\n   descriptive. Old names still work but they are deprecated:\\n   - `package_name` \u2192 `downstream_package_name`\\n   - `upstream_name` \u2192 `upstream_project_name`\\n2. You don\'t need to touch dist-git at all when getting your new upstream\\n   release into Fedora, you can stay in your upstream repository and just fire\\n   off a bunch of packit calls:\\n   - `packit propose-update` to create a pull request in Fedora dist-git with\\n     the selected upstream release\\n   - `packit build` to build the new upstream release once the pull request is\\n     merged\\n   - and finally, `packit create-update` creates a new bodhi update (if you\\n     chose a stable Fedora release)\\n3. Packit now has a `srpm` command which creates an SRPM out of the local\\n   content of your upstream repository.\\n4. You can now use packit to sync files from your dist-git repo back into\\n   upstream (mainly to keep spec files in sync). `sync-from-downstream` is the\\n   command.\\n5. Command `propose-update` received numerous improvements:\\n   - You can pick upstream version to use.\\n   - Packit will NOT check out the git ref with the upstream release if you\\n     specify `--local-content`\\n   - It\'s possible to force packit to execute `fedpkg new-sources` using\\n     `--force-new-sources` and bypass the caching mechanism.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nPlease make sure you are installing `0.2.0`:\\n\\n```\\n$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit\\n```\\n\\nOr\\n\\n```\\n$ pip3 install --user packitos\\n```\\n\\nYou can also install packit from master branch, if you are brave enough:\\n\\n```\\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit\\n```\\n\\n## How are we using packit?\\n\\nI\'d like to show you how we used packit to bring a new upstream\\nrelease of ogr into Fedora, a library which packit is using.\\n\\nOnce we have performed an upstream release of ogr, we can propose an update in\\ndist-git:\\n\\n```\\n$ git clone https://github.com/packit-service/ogr && cd ogr/\\n\\n$ packit propose-update\\nINFO: Running \'anitya\' versioneer\\nVersion in upstream registries is \'0.0.3\'.\\nVersion in spec file is \'0.0.3\'.\\nPicking version of the latest release from the upstream registry over spec file.\\nChecking out upstream version 0.0.3\\nUsing \'master\' dist-git branch\\nCloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr.git -> /tmp/tmpb9xlvdhj\\nSyncing /home/tt/g/user-cont/ogr/python-ogr.spec\\nArchive ogr-0.0.3.tar.gz found in lookaside cache (skipping upload).\\nERROR    Cmd(\'git\') failed due to: exit code(1)\\n  cmdline: git commit -s -m [packit] 0.0.3 upstream release -m Upstream tag: 0.0.3\\nUpstream commit: 059d21080a7849acff4626b6e0ec61830d537ac4\\n\\n  stdout: \'On branch 0.0.3-master-update\\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\'\\n```\\n\\nWhoops, it seems that I have messed up, I forgot to bump the spec file in the\\nupstream repo when doing the release. I will bump it locally and utilize\\n`--local-content` argument:\\n\\n```\\n$ rpmdev-bumpspec -n 0.1.0 -c \'New upstream release: 0.1.0\' *.spec\\n\\n$ packit propose-update --local-content\\nINFO: Running \'anitya\' versioneer\\nVersion in upstream registries is \'0.0.3\'.\\nVersion in spec file is \'0.1.0\'.\\nPicking version of the latest release from the upstream registry over spec file.\\nUsing \'master\' dist-git branch\\nCloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr.git -> /tmp/tmpd9j4se27\\nSyncing /home/tt/g/user-cont/ogr/python-ogr.spec\\nArchive ogr-0.1.0.tar.gz found in lookaside cache (skipping upload).\\nINFO: Downloading file from URL https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/source/o/ogr/ogr-0.1.0.tar.gz\\n100%[=============================>]    20.25K  eta 00:00:00\\nDownloaded archive: \'/tmp/tmpd9j4se27/ogr-0.1.0.tar.gz\'\\nAbout to upload to lookaside cache\\nwon\'t be doing kinit, no credentials provided\\nPR created: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr/pull-request/6\\n```\\n\\nOnce the scratch build is done and tests passed we merged and built it:\\n\\n```\\n$ packit build\\nUsing \'master\' dist-git branch\\nCloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr.git -> /tmp/tmprp3cmdjy\\nBuilding python-ogr-0.1.0-1.fc31 for rawhide\\nCreated task: 33616980\\nTask info: https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=33616980\\n```\\n\\nWe have done the same for F30 and F29.\\n\\nThe previous commands were run in the directory of the upstream repository. Packit also accepts path to your upstream clone, or even URL. So let\'s create a bodhi update for python-ogr by specifying the upstream repo URL:\\n\\n```\\n$ cd $HOME\\n\\n$ packit create-update --dist-git-branch f29 https://github.com/packit-service/ogr\\nCloning repo: https://github.com/packit-service/ogr -> /tmp/tmpdkdadmn_\\nKoji builds for package python-ogr and koji tag f29-updates-candidate:\\n - python-ogr-0.1.0-1.fc29\\nCloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-ogr.git -> /tmp/tmpn1809ec9\\nBodhi update FEDORA-2019-78948e62d2:\\n- https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2019-78948e62d2\\n- stable_karma: 3\\n- unstable_karma: -3\\n- notes:\\nNew upstream release: 0.1.0\\n```\\n\\nAnd that\'s it, no need to access dist-git any more.\\n\\nPlease give packit a try and let us know what you think.\\n\\n# Packit 0.3.0 (2019-04-11)\\n\\nIn the previous post we promised to\\nprovide a new release every 2 weeks and we are already breaking this promise as\\nit\'s been 3 weeks since then. We decided to wait with the release to merge\\nseveral pull requests related to source-git support.\\n\\nNow the good news. You can find a complete list of new features and\\nimprovements of version\\n[0.3.0](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/releases/tag/0.3.0) in the\\n[changelog](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#030).\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- You can now specify your own hooks or actions to replace default packit\\n  behaviour. (More information can be found [in the\\n  documentation](/docs/configuration/actions/)).\\n- Packit supports pagure.io-based upstream projects.\\n- Commands `propose-update` and `sync-from-downstream` supports [copying\\n  directories](/docs/configuration/#minimal-sample-config).\\n- A new command `status`! It displays useful upstream/downstream info.\\n- Packit now supports [Source-git](/source-git/). The\\n  functionality is not available, yet - we will add a CLI interface for it in\\n  the next release.\\n- You can now have a config file for packit in your home directory(`~/.config/packit.yaml`).\\n- Packit installed from an RPM now has manpages.\\n\\n### `packit status` example\\n\\n```bash\\n$ packit status\\nCloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/packit.git -> /tmp/tmp84we_6n8\\nDownstream PRs: No open PRs.\\nf29: 0.2.0\\nf30: 0.2.0\\nmaster: 0.2.0\\n```\\n\\n# Packit 0.4.0 & 0.4.1 (2019-05-18)\\n\\nIt\'s been over a month since we released packit \\"0.3.0\\". Here comes packit 0.4.0 (and patch release 0.4.1) and as always they bring a lot of new features and improvements.\\n\\nYou can find a complete list in the\\n[changelog](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#040).\\n\\n## Packit as a service\\n\\n- We have Packit as a service running in OpenShift and also a GitHub App, which uses it.\\n  Unfortunately it\'s still not in the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace),\\n  so [we](https://github.com/packit-service) have been the only one using it so far.\\n  The service/app submits builds in [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/packit/) and\\n  once they\'re done it adds a GitHub status and comment with instructions how to install the builds.\\n  The service is now configurable via [jobs](/docs/configuration/#packit-service-jobs) defined\\n  in configuration file.\\n- Packit is now able to check GPG signatures of the upstream commits against configured fingerprints.\\n\\n## CLI\\n\\n- `srpm` command now works also with [Source-git](/source-git/).\\n- `status` command now access remote APIs asynchronously in parallel, which should speed up\\n  the execution.\\n- CLI has new `--dry-run` option to not perform any remote changes (pull requests or comments).\\n- Fedmsg parsing has been unified into a single `listen-to-fedmsg` command.\\n\\n# Packit 0.4.2 (2019-06-26)\\n\\nAnother relase after a month since [0.4.1](https://packit.dev/posts/packit-041/), this time mostly with bug fixes.\\n\\nWe\'ve been busy polishing our [GitHub App](https://packit.dev/packit-as-a-service/) recently, therefore we had no resources for new features.\\n\\nSee [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#042) for more details.\\n\\n# September 2020\\n\\n## Week 36 (August 31th - September 4th)\\n\\n- We store the submission time of SRPM builds now ([packit-service#795](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/795) by [Anchit]).\\n- [Shreyas] improved implementation of the build status reporting ([packit-service#740](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/740)).\\n- [Anchit] enhanced the `/koji-builds` endpoint to be more consistent with `/copr-builds` endpoint ([packit-service#791](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/791)).\\n\\n[anchit]: https://github.com/IceWreck\\n[shreyas]: https://github.com/shreyaspapi\\n\\n## Week 37 (September 7th - September 11th)\\n\\n- Stage now uses [Tokman](https://github.com/packit/tokman) to get access tokens for GitHub, which should resolve race condition when running parallel jobs\\n  (Tokman by [Hunor], ogr integration by [Matej]).\\n- [Franta] has addressed problems with Testing-Farm cluster with custom response on PRs that links to more information ([pinned info](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/803), [packit-service#798](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/798)).\\n\\n[hunor]: https://github.com/csomh\\n[matej]: https://github.com/mfocko\\n[franta]: https://github.com/lachmanfrantisek\\n\\n## Week 38 (September 14th - September 18th)\\n\\n- The combination of the source-git patches with existing patches now works well\\n  ([packit#963](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/963)).\\n- Service now mostly supports also GitLab as you can see\\n  [here](https://gitlab.com/packit-service/hello-world/-/merge_requests/10)\\n  or [here](https://gitlab.com/packit-service/src/drpm/-/merge_requests/2).\\n  A lot of small issues were fixed in the last week\\n  ([packit-service#806](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/806),\\n  [packit-service#812](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/812),\\n  [packit-service#814](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/814),\\n  [packit-service#815](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/815),\\n  [packit-service#816](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/816)\\n  ).\\n- Created Copr projects are now prefixed with the hostname\\n  for non-GitHub services and also support multipart namespaces\\n  ([packit-service#819](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/819)).\\n- [Laura] fixed two testing-farm related issues\\n  ([packit-service#808](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/808),\\n  [packit-service#809](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/809)).\\n  You can now use `test` job also on Pagure and GitLab thanks to that.\\n\\n[laura]: https://github.com/lbarcziova\\n\\n## Week 39 (September 21st - September 25th)\\n\\n- Packit-service can be configured to work with private namespaces. This is plumbing work which we need right now for CentOS Stream. We are not planning to enable this for GitHub - packit-service will still work only for public repositories, private ones are ignored. [packit-service#831](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/831)\\n- If git tag contains more information than just version (e.g. `pkg_name-v1.2.3`), it is possible to use upstream_tag_template to extract version from the tag, which will be used in a subsequent task. [doc](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#upstream_tag_template) [packit#959](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/959)\\n- Added support for globbing pattern in upstream_ref. [doc](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#upstream_ref) [packit#960](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/960)\\n- Packit `--remote` is global option now and available for all commands. Because of this `sync-from-downstream --remote` was renamed to `--remote-to-push`. Remote can now be specified in the user\'s config (via upstream_git_remote parameter). [packit#977](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/977)\\n\\nFollowing bugs were fixed:\\n\\n- Packit dropping leading zeros in version. [packit#814](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/814)\\n- Packit CLI issue caused by picking incorrect copr project name. [packit#971](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/971)\\n\\n## Week 40 (September 28th - October 2nd)\\n\\n- Packit-service is now explicitly checking if requested copr-build targets exist and if not, the user is informed about it. [packit-service#835](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/835)\\n- We have improved the way how packit updates `%setup` line in a spec file - you are now able to set content of `-n` option via archive_root_dir_template config option, it defaults to `{upstream-pkg-name}`. [doc](https://github.com/packit/packit.dev/pull/167) [packit#834](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/834)\\n- Packit is able to generate a patch file with format-patch without leading a/ and b/ in the patch diff. Required for patches in dist-git which are applied with -p0.\\n- Contribution guidelines were updated, now we have one shared [link](https://github.com/packit/contributing).\\n\\n# Week 44-48 (November) 2019\\n\\nWith this blog post we\'d like to continue with the idea of openly communicating changes in Packit.\\nSince most of the developers use Packit as the [GitHub App](https://packit.dev/packit-as-a-service) (which uses code from [this repository - Packit Service](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service)), this blog will be about changes in all the parts, i.e. the GitHub App, the Packit Service and Packit itself.\\n\\n## Continuous Deployment (CD)\\n\\nAt the moment the workflow is that one of us manually triggers production container image build at the end of a week.\\nThis image is then automatically deployed into our production instance of the service over a weekend (Sun/Mon night) so that everyone can start a week with all the amazing stuff we added the previous week.\\nIn case an issue makes it through our staging instance into production uncaught, we can easily rollback on Monday.\\nThe same person also writes down what\'s changed in Packit (service/app) since previous deployment.\\n\\n## Changes in production (since the end of November)\\n\\nPrevious post is almost half a year old so we won\'t list all the changes since then, but only since last deployment, i.e. since end of December.\\n\\n### Packit\\n\\nPrevious deployment was running [packit-0.7.1](https://pypi.org/project/packitos/0.7.1/).\\nWe haven\'t released a newer version since then, but in the service we install Packit from the Git repository (we have a separate `stable` git branch for our production deployment).\\nFrom the most visible changes, Packit now:\\n\\n- better handles Create-archive action\\n- is able to work in a repo with detached head\\n- logs output from subprocesses in realtime\\n- syncs config file and spec file by default in Propose-update action\\n- hadles patches with undecodable chars\\n\\n### Packit Service\\n\\nNow:\\n\\n- better reports Copr builds\\n  - uses separate commit status for srpm build and every chroot\\n  - clears test farm commit statuses when new build is triggered\\n  - better handles failed Copr builds\\n- gracefully handles no config file in the repo\\n- better handles when no (copr build) targets are specified in config file\\n- better checks whitelist of users\\n- does not create duplicate tickets in our [notification repo](https://github.com/packit-service/notifications) when a new user install the app\\n\\nChanges not visible to end users:\\n\\n- using [Requre](https://github.com/packit-service/requre) for integration/E2E tests\\n- Fedora messaging consumer part of the service has been improved and moved to separate [repo/image](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service-fedmsg)\\n- using FAS instead of Fedora Badges for checking whether a user is Fedora packager\\n- many improved logs\\n- many bugs squashed\\n- lot\'s of code refactored\\n\\n# December 2019\\n\\n## Week 49\\n\\n### ogr & packit\\n\\n- ogr-0.9.0 has been released greatly restructured. ([#291](https://github.com/packit-service/ogr/pull/291/files))\\n- `packit status` (CLI) now shows also latest Copr builds. ([#579](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/579))\\n- Target aliases (currently `fedora-development`, `fedora-stable`, `fedora-all`) can now be used in the packit config file. ([#619](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/619))\\n- When doing a new update in Fedora dist-git, packit now by default creates a new pull request instead of pushing directly to dist-git. ([#622](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/622))\\n\\n### packit service\\n\\n- Does not set test checks when tests are not configured. ([#275](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/275))\\n- Supports target aliases and dist-git branches aliases. ([#277](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/277), [#285](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/285))\\n- Nicely formats errors from OpenShift API. ([#283](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/283))\\n- Runs Copr build when user adds a `/packit build` comment into a PR. ([#290](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/290))\\n\\n## Week 50\\n\\n### packit\\n\\n- If there is no `upstream_package_name`/`downstream_package_name` given in `.packit.yaml`, they now default to the name of the GitHub repo. ([#624](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/624))\\n- If no `jobs` are defined in `.packit.yaml` packit by default runs `build` job on `fedora-stable` targets and `propose_downstream` on `fedora-all` branches. ([#625](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/625))\\n- `build` command has nicer output. ([#630](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/630))\\n- Smaller fixes. ([#630](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/630), [#636](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/636))\\n\\n### packit service\\n\\n- Creates a new issue when `propose-update` fails. ([#300](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/300))\\n- Better reports failed submitting of a Copr build. ([#301](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/pull/301))"}]}')}}]);
