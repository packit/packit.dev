# `packit prepare-sources`

Prepares sources for a new SRPM build using the content of the upstream repository.
Applies the same as for `packit srpm`, but instead of building a SRPM in the end,
prepared sources are moved to the `result-dir`.


## Requirements

* Upstream project is using git.
* Packit config file placed in the upstream repository.
