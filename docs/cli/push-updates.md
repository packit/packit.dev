# `packit push-updates`

Push the Bodhi updates that have been in testing for more than 'Stable days' (7 by default)
to the stable.

If you are not authenticated with the bodhi server, please make sure that you
navigate in your browser to the URL provided by the bodhi-client and then paste
the `code=XX...` to the terminal when prompted.

If you set `fas_user` and `kerberos_realm` in your "~/.config/packit.yaml" and
have an active Kerberos TGT, you will be automatically authenticated.
