# `packit source-git status`

Examine the sync status of a source-git and a dist-git repository.

This command informs whether the commits in source-git and dist-git are
in sync or about the ranges of commit that need to be synchronized using
`update-source-git` and `update-dist-git` commands in order to make them
synced. If possible, the status command aims to provide instructions on
how to sync the repositories.
