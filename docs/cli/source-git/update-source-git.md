# `packit source-git update-source-git`

Sync changes made in a dist-git repository back to the corresponding
source-git repository.

This is to enable engineers and bots to capture and sync back changes done
in dist-git (by provenpackagers during rebuilds, for example). This is why
changes to the source and patches are not supported! If a package has a
source-git repository set up, the expectation is that the bulk of the
packaging work is going to happen there.
