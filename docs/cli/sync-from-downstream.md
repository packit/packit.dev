# `packit sync-from-downstream`

This is a detailed documentation for the downstream sync functionality of packit. The
command creates a new pull request in upstream repository using a
selected branch (main by default) from Fedora dist-git repository.

## Requirements

* Fedora dist-git repository.
* Packit config file placed in the upstream repository.
* Pagure API tokens for Fedora Dist-git.
* GitHub API token.

## Tutorial

* Starting with packit 0.5.2 and later, you only need to set a single token to
  interact with dist-git. You needed two in the past. Please populate your
  local config at `~/.config/packit.yaml` for packit so it can talk to the
  remote services:

```yaml
# you can obtain the token over here: https://github.com/settings/tokens
github_token: 123
# and this one right here: https://src.fedoraproject.org/settings#nav-api-tab
pagure_user_token: 456
```

* The files which are synced are listed in `.packit.yaml` under the `files_to_sync` configuration key.

* Once you want to sync Fedora dist-git repo into the upstream repo,
  run `packit sync-from-downstream` in a working directory of your upstream
  repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/user-cont/colin.git
$ cd colin
$ packit sync-from-downstream
upstream active branch master
Cloning repo: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/colin.git -> /tmp/tmph9npe78e
using master dist-git branch
syncing /tmp/tmph9npe78e/colin.spec
PR created: https://api.github.com/repos/phracek/colin/pulls/3
```
