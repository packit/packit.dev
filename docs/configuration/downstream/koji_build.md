# `job: koji_build`

![Koji build](../../img/configuration/koji-info.png)

Trigger the build in
[Fedora Koji](https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/) build system
as a reaction to a new dist-git commit.
A Packit config file needs to be in the dist-git repository
to allow this job to be triggered.
Packit loads the config from the default dist-git branch (usually `rawhide`). Packit configs on other branches are ignored.

The build is triggered only for commits with a spec-file change.

By default, only merged pull requests created by Packit are being acted upon so the [proven packager
workflow](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fesco/Provenpackager_policy/) is
preserved, [details
here](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/1490). You can override this behaviour by specifying
`allowed_pr_authors` and/or `allowed_committers` in the job configuration (see below). For direct pushes, the committer needs to
be specified in the  `allowed_committers` and for merged pull requests the author of the PR needs to be
specified in the `allowed_pr_authors`.

:::warning

Due to a [bug](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/2537), if you merge a PR containing more than one
commit or push more than one commit directly, the job may not be triggered even though all conditions are met.
In such case please [trigger it manually](/docs/retriggering#koji_build).

:::

Packit provides an overview of its own builds [here](https://dashboard.packit.dev/jobs/downstream-koji-builds).

The koji build behaves as it was created manually, and you can utilise
[Fedora Notifications](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/notifications/about)
to be informed about the builds. Also, you can configure a repository where should we
open issues in case of errors during the job via [`issue_repository`](/docs/configuration#issue_repository) configuration key.

For Koji builds from upstream, see [`upstream_koji_build`](/docs/configuration/upstream/upstream_koji_build).

:::tip Downstream configuration template

You can use our [downstream configuration template](/docs/configuration/downstream_configuration_template) 
for creating your Packit configuration in dist-git repository.

:::

:::tip Automate the setup

You can also use [packit dist-git init](/docs/cli/dist-git/init.md) CLI command to create your
Packit dist-git configuration.

:::

## Supported triggers

* **commit** - reacts to new commits to the specified branch (in dist-git)
* **koji_build** - reacts to tagging of a Koji build into the configured sidetag group
  More info about releasing multiple packages together using sidetags can be found
  [here](/docs/fedora-releases-guide/releasing-multiple-packages.md).

:::tip You can use both triggers simultaneously

```yaml
- job: koji_build
  trigger: commit | koji_build
```

:::

## Required parameters

* **dist_git_branches** - the name of the dist-git branch we want to build for.
  You can also use the [aliases provided by Packit](/docs/configuration#aliases)
  to not need to change the config file when the new system version is released.

## Optional parameters

* **scratch** - defaults to `false`, use to create scratch (test) builds
  instead of the real production builds
* **allowed_pr_authors** - a list of PR authors whose merged pull requests will trigger Koji builds
  (defaults to `['packit']`). As each item of the list you can specify:
   - name of a FAS account, e.g. `my-fas`
   - name of a group - starting with `@`, e.g. `@my-sig`
     (don't forget to put the group name in quotes - a token in YAML is not allowed to start with `@`)
   - `all_admins` alias - allowing all users with admin access to the dist-git repo
   - `all_committers` alias - allowing all users with commit access to the dist-git repo
* **allowed_committers** - a list of committers whose direct pushes to dist-git will trigger Koji builds
  (defaults to an empty list). It is enough to configure the `allowed_pr_authors` option if you want to have Koji builds 
  triggered only by merged pull requests.
  Similarly to the previous option, as each item of the list you can specify:
   - name of a FAS account, e.g. `my-fas`
   - name of a group - starting with `@`, e.g. `@my-sig`
     (don't forget to put the group name in quotes - a token in YAML is not allowed to start with `@`)
   - `all_admins` alias - allowing all users with admin access to the dist-git repo
   - `all_committers` alias - allowing all users with commit access to the dist-git repo
* **sidetag_group** - name of a sidetag group this Koji build should be tagged into.
  The name has to be unique across all projects that use Packit, so don't hesitate to be descriptive.
  A good convention is to use `${package1}-${package2}...${packageN}-updates`.
  If specified, after a build finishes it is tagged into a sidetag (that is created if it doesn't already exist)
  corresponding to the dist-git branch of the build.
* **dependencies** - list of downstream package names that are required to be tagged
  into the configured sidetag group for this job to be triggered. For example, if you want to ensure
  that a `koji_build` job with the same sidetag group configured in package `foo` is run first,
  you need to list `foo` here.
* **dependents** - list of downstream package names that should react to tagging of this build
  into the configured sidetag group. For example, if a `koji_build` job with the same sidetag group
  configured in package `bar` is supposed to be triggered after this build finishes, you need to
  list `bar` here.
* **require.label** - you can specify labels that have to be present/absent on a pull request
  in order to trigger the build when it is merged. See configuration details [here](/docs/configuration#require).

## Retriggering

For retriggering the job, see [retriggering docs](/docs/retriggering#koji_build).
