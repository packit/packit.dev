This is a template for configuration of Packit's Fedora release automation (dist-git only).

## How to use the template
1. copy the content
2. create a `packit.yaml`/`.packit.yaml` file in root directory of your dist-git repository in your `rawhide` branch
and paste the content
3. resolve the TODOs
4. (optionally) run [`packit config validate`](/docs/cli/config/validate) to make sure the configuration is valid

## Template
```yaml
# See the documentation for more information:
# https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/

# TODO optionally fill in the URL to the upstream Git repo (one that can be passed to anonymous `git clone`)
# this can be omitted, but in that case there will be no interaction with the upstream repo (no cloning)
#upstream_project_url: https://github.com/<upstream-repository>

# TODO optionally uncomment and fill in the URL of repository where you want to be notified via issues about errors
#issue_repository: https://github.com/<my-repo-for-issues>

# TODO uncomment and adjust the template if the upstream tags do not match the version strings.
# (Only relevant if your upstream project is a git repository (= `upstream_project_url` is set).
# https://packit.dev/docs/configuration#upstream_tag_template
#upstream_tag_template: v{version}

# TODO uncomment and adjust if you want Packit to filter upstream tags that should be reacted upon
# applies only when `upstream_project_url` is configured
# https://packit.dev/docs/configuration#upstream_tag_include
# https://packit.dev/docs/configuration#upstream_tag_exclude
#upstream_tag_include: <python-regex>
#upstream_tag_exclude: <python-regex>

jobs:
# https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/downstream/pull_from_upstream
# TODO make sure there is Fedora mapping for the upstream project in https://release-monitoring.org/projects/
# TODO make sure Monitoring status on the left side at https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/<your-package> is set to Monitoring

  dist_git_branches:
    # TODO adjust the list of branches for which the release should be synced

  # TODO customization of changelog entry of the new release and Packit's commit message
  # default behaviour:
  # - changelog entry contains '- Update to version <version>' and references the bugzilla about new release
  # - commit message contains info about the upstream release and references the bugzilla about new release  
  # you can choose one of the following options below to customize the behaviour:
  
  # option 1: generate your custom changelog entry and/or commit message
  # uncomment and adjust the commands to your needs
  
  #actions:
  #  commit-message:
  #  - bash -c 'echo "Update to ${PACKIT_PROJECT_VERSION}"'
  #  - bash -c '[ -z "$PACKIT_RESOLVED_BUGS" ] || echo ${PACKIT_RESOLVED_BUGS} | tr " " "\n" | sed "s/^/- Resolves /"'
  #  - bash -c 'echo "- Upstream tag - ${PACKIT_UPSTREAM_TAG}"'

  #  - bash -c '[ -z "$PACKIT_RESOLVED_BUGS" ] || echo ${PACKIT_RESOLVED_BUGS} | tr " " "\n" | sed "s/^/- Resolves /"'

  # option 2: enable copy_upstream_release_description flag so that upstream release description is set as 
  # changelog entry (works for GitHub and GitLab upstreams only)
