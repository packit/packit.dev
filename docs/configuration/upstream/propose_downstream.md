# `job: propose_downstream`

Land a new upstream release in Fedora (or CentOS Stream). This job only makes sure the changes
happen in dist-git - no builds. A pull request is created as a result.

Packit gets the information about the newly created release (not a git tag) from GitHub/GitLab,
loads the config from the release commit and if there is a `propose_downstream` job
defined, the workflow begins. 

For enabling the propose downstream job, you need to have
[Packit Service installed](/docs/guide/#1-set-up-packit-integration)
and have a `propose_downstream` job in the configuration file for the given upstream repository
(this job is also run by default if there is no `jobs` section
in the configuration, see [jobs configuration](/docs/configuration/#packit-service-jobs)).
The [propose_downstream job](/docs/configuration/upstream/propose_downstream) should be then configured like this:

```yaml
jobs:
- job: propose_downstream
  trigger: release
  dist_git_branches:
    - main
```
You can adjust the `dist_git_branches` field to include the
dist-git branches you want to update and also utilise [aliases](/docs/configuration/#aliases) 
instead of using hardcoded versions.

During proposing a new update, you will get updates of the job status via commit statuses/checks
on the release commit. These will provide links to our dashboard where you can find all the information about 
the job including the logs. You can also check all propose downstream runs in 
[this view](https://dashboard.packit.dev/jobs/propose-downstreams).

:::tip CentOS Stream support

We newly support `propose-downstream` also for CentOS Stream. The workflow is the same as for Fedora, but there are few
configuration specifics, see [the subsection below](#syncing-the-release-to-centos-stream).

:::

## Supported triggers

* **release**

## Optional parameters

* **dist_git_branches** 
  - a (list of) branches in dist-git where packit should work (defaults to `main` which represents _Fedora Rawhide_).
  - or a dict whose *keys* are the names of the dist-git branches where packit synchronizes release changes 
  and the *values* are in the form of an empty dict `{}` or as 
  `{fast_forward_merge_into: [other branches names]}`. In the second example, packit tries to fast forward
  the changes created for the *key branch* in the *other branches* opening a pull request for them.

:::info
For how to keep dist-git branches non-divergent 
please see the details [here](/docs/fedora-releases-guide#keep-dist-git-branches-non-divergent).
:::
  
  As branch names you can also use the [aliases provided by Packit](/docs/configuration#aliases)
  to not need to change the config file when the new system version is released.

* [**notifications.failure_issue.create**](/docs/configuration#failure_issue) - whether to create an upstream issue about failure. Defaults to `true`.


## Example

```yaml
jobs:
- job: propose_downstream
  trigger: release
- job: propose_downstream
  trigger: release
  dist_git_branches:
    - f39
```

This config would update Fedora Rawhide and Fedora 39 dist-git branches.

## Retriggering
Users with write or admin permissions to the repository can retrigger an
update via a comment in any open issue in the upstream repository:

    /packit propose-downstream


## Syncing the release to CentOS Stream

Recently, we have implemented support for `propose-downstrem` also for CentOS Stream. This means that you can now configure
the upstream release to trigger release syncing the same way as for Fedora to CentOS Stream dist-git repositories
hosted in https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms.

:::caution

This integration has just been added, so we will be happy if you could help us
test it out and improve it! If you come across any issues or have suggestions for improvement, 
please take a moment to [report them to us](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/new). 
We value general feedback as well, so don't hesitate to [reach out](/#contact)!

:::


:::caution

At the moment, the upload to lookaside cache is being bypassed in the Packit service.
If you prefer having this step handled by the automation, you can  
use [Packit CLI](/docs/cli/propose-downstream) instead.

:::

To sync the release to CentOS Stream, you currently need to specify the following parameters:
- `pkg_tool: centpkg` (the default is `fedpkg`)
- `dist_git_branches`:  a list of dist-git branches, e.g. `c8s`, `c9s`

Besides that, you need to:
1. specify the [`packages`](/docs/configuration#packages) with distinct items for Fedora and CentOS Stream. 
For each `packages` item, include configuration specifics tailored to the respective environment. This may
be setting the `pkg_tool` option and, in case of different specfiles being used in Fedora and CentOS Stream, 
specifying distinct `actions` for downloading the specfiles as needed.
2. specify the particular packages in the jobs (as `packages: [my-package-fedora]` for Fedora-related jobs and 
`[packages: my-package-centos]` for CentOS Stream-related job)

Here is an example of such a configuration:
```yaml
---
downstream_package_name: nispor
upstream_project_url: https://github.com/nispor/nispor
issue_repository: https://github.com/nispor/nispor
update_release: false
upstream_package_name: nispor
upstream_tag_template: v{version}
copy_upstream_release_description: false

packages:
  nispor-fedora:
    actions:
      post-upstream-clone:
        - wget https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/nispor/raw/rawhide/f/nispor.spec
  nispor-centos:
    pkg_tool: centpkg
    actions:
      post-upstream-clone:
        - wget https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/nispor/-/raw/c9s/nispor.spec

jobs:
  - job: propose_downstream
    trigger: release
    packages: [nispor-fedora]
    dist_git_branches:
      - fedora

  - job: propose_downstream
    trigger: release
    packages: [nispor-centos]
    dist_git_branches:
      - c9s
```
