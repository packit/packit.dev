# `job: vm_image_build`

## Supported triggers

* **pull_request** 

## Required parameters

Image Parameters (Packit does not sanitize these and just passes them to Image Builder;
check [Image Builder's API
documentation](https://console.redhat.com/docs/api/image-builder) for details).

* **image_request** - values passed to [the "image_requests" field](https://console.redhat.com/docs/api/image-builder/v1#operations-default-ComposeImage) of Image Builder's API
* **image_customizations** - values passed to [the "customizations" field](https://console.redhat.com/docs/api/image-builder/v1#operations-default-ComposeImage) of Image Builder's API
* **image_distribution** - name of the "base image" (examples: rhel-90, fedora-36)

## Optional parameters

* **owner** - Copr project owner
* **project** - Copr project name
* **copr_chroot** - name of the chroot to use for installing packages in the image

Image builds are only triggered after a collaborator places a comment `/packit
vm-image-build` in a pull request. The image builds are **NOT** submitted
automatically. This is a subject to change as we improve the integration in future.
