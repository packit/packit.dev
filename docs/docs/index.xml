      <description>You can probably find yourself in a situation where some part of the packit workflow needs to be tweaked for your package.
Packit supports actions, a way to change default implementation for a command of your choice. Packit is able to execute more commands. Each action can accept a list of commands. By default, the commands are executed directly and not in a shell - if you need shell, just wrap your command like this: bash -c &amp;quot;my fancy $command | grep success&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Agenda Being fully on-board of the packit train may take some time and effort. This is why we decided to split the on-boarding process into multiple checkpoints:
 Have packit tooling installed locally. RPM builds pass on your laptop. You are approved to use packit-service. The project has successful builds inside the service. Packit service handles Fedora Rawhide updates for you.  The guide We welcome all the suggestions to this guide, feel free to open a new issue here.</description>

      <description>Packit uses a configuration file in the upstream repository. The config file is written in YAML language.
You should place the file in the root of your upstream repo. Packit accepts these names:
 .packit.yaml .packit.yml .packit.json packit.yaml packit.yml packit.json  Both Packit-as-a-Service and packit tool use this configuration file.
Top level keys    Key name Type Description     specfile_path string relative path to a spec file within the upstream repository (if not specified, Packit will recursively search the tree and use the first spec file found)   upstream_project_name string deprecated since packit-0.</description>

      <description>This is a practical introduction to source-git using a real example.
If you are interested in the theory behind source-git, please read the specification.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a source-git repo I choose systemd from Fedora 29 for this example.
What do we need? 3 things:
 Systemd upstream repo. Fedora 29 dist-git repo of systemd. New local git repo.  Let&amp;rsquo;s set all of this up. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with an empty git repository:</description>
