	"content": " You can probably find yourself in a situation where some part of the packit workflow needs to be tweaked for your package.\nPackit supports actions, a way to change default implementation for a command of your choice. Packit is able to execute more commands. Each action can accept a list of commands. By default, the commands are executed directly and not in a shell - if you need shell, just wrap your command like this: bash -c \u0026quot;my fancy $command | grep success\u0026quot;.\nAll the actions are also executed inside Packit-as-a-Service. The service creates a new sandbox environment where the command is ran.\nActions have a default behaviour which you can override, hooks don\u0026rsquo;t have any - hooks are a way for you to perform operations after packit does a specific event, e.g. clones an upstream repo.\nCurrently, these are the actions you can use:\npropose-update command     name working directory when run description     [hook] post-upstream-clone upstream git repo after cloning of the upstream repo (master) and before other operations    [hook] pre-sync upstream git repo after cloning and checkout to the correct (release) branch     prepare-files upstream git repo after cloning, checking out of both upstream and dist-git repos replace patching and archive generation    create-patches upstream git repo after sync of upstream files to the downstream replace patching    create-archive upstream git repo when the archive needs to be created replace the code for creating an archive    get-current-version upstream git repo when the current version needs to be found expect version as a stdout    Creating SRPM These applies to srpm command and building in COPR.\n    name working directory when run description     [hook] post-upstream-clone upstream git repo after cloning of the upstream repo (master) and before other operations     get-current-version upstream git repo when the current version needs to be found expect version as a stdout    create-archive upstream git repo when the archive needs to be created replace the code for creating an archive    create-patches upstream git repo after sync of upstream files to the downstream replace patching    fix-spec-file upstream git repo after creation of a tarball and before running rpmbuild command this action changes spec file to use the new tarball    create-archive - is expected to return the created archive name. If there are more steps, then one of them has to return the archive name.\nfix-spec-file — this action performs these 3 operations on a spec file:\n Replaces Source0 with a local path to the generated tarball Changes first %setup (or %autosetup) macro in %prep and adds -n so the generated tarball can be unpacked Changes %version  As an example how to use this, a package may define more Sources - in such a case, default implementation of fix-spec-file won\u0026rsquo;t be able to update %prep correctly. You can write a simple shell script and use sed to set the new Sources correctly, e.g. sed -i packaging/fedora/snapd.spec -e \u0026quot;s/https.*only-vendor.tar.xz/$correct_tarball_path/\u0026quot;\nEnvironment variables set by packit Additionally, packit sets a few env vars for specific actions\nfix-spec-file\nPACKIT_PROJECT_VERSION — current version of the project (coming from git describe) PACKIT_PROJECT_COMMIT — commit hash of the top commit PACKIT_PROJECT_ARCHIVE — expected name of the archive\ncreate-archive\nPACKIT_PROJECT_VERSION — current version of the project (coming from git describe) PACKIT_PROJECT_NAME_VERSION — current name and version of the project (coming from git describe)\nIn your package config they can be defined like this:\nspecfile_path: package.spec synced_files: - packit.yaml - package.spec upstream_package_name: package downstream_package_name: package dist_git_url: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/package.git actions: prepare-files: \u0026quot;make prepare\u0026quot; create-archive: - \u0026quot;make archive\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;ls\u0026quot;  "

	"content": "We would like to announce general availability of the initial version of packit, titled \u0026lsquo;0.1.0\u0026rsquo;.\nSince this is our first release, we would like to ask you to be patient if you encounter any issues. We work hard on packit\u0026rsquo;s usability. If you feel like that packit is doing something weird or if anything is unclear, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate and reach out to us by creating a new Github issue.\nThe initial release contains two commands:\n packit propose-update — Opens a pull request in dist-git for the latest upstream release of a selected repository. packit watch-releases — Watches events for all the upstream releases and performs propose-update for those who use packit.  Installation $ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit  Or\n$ pip3 install --user packitos  Or (if you\u0026rsquo;re brave)\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit  Requirements Present features have strict requirements on the upstream projects:\n You need to have a packit config file present in the upstream repo.\n You need to have spec file present in the upstream repo.\n  This workflow is suitable for people who are both upstream and downstream maintainers of the particular project. If you don\u0026rsquo;t fit into that bucket, then packit might not be ready for you, yet. Please wait till we land more source-git related functionality into packit.\npropose-update I\u0026rsquo;m going to demonstrate this functionality on ogr, our library for git forges, which powers packit.\nIt was recently approved for Fedora, so we can use packit to bring the initial version of ogr into Fedora Rawhide, 30 and 29.\nDo we have everything? Let\u0026rsquo;s see guide for the propose-update command on what we need:\n0. The upstream repository with a valid upstream release. $ git remote -v origin git@github.com:TomasTomecek/ogr.git (fetch) origin git@github.com:TomasTomecek/ogr.git (push) upstream https://github.com/packit-service/ogr.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/packit-service/ogr.git (push)  Yup.\n$ git tag --list 0.0.1 0.0.2 0.0.3 $ git checkout 0.0.3 Note: checking out '0.0.3'.

	"content": " Packit-as-a-Service is a GitHub App that helps you continuously ensure that your project work in Fedora OS.\nEasy to use Using Packit Service is very straightforward: add one config file to your repository together with the RPM spec file and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\nPackit Service validates your pull requests by building your software in Fedora OS. Once the builds are done, Packit lets you know how to install the RPMs inside your environment so you can try the changes before merging them.\nOptionally, Packit Service can run tests for the built software (i.e. copr builds) in all current Fedora OS releases via Testing Farm.\nPackit is also available as a CLI tool, so you can always try things locally on your own. Note that testing is not currently supported with the CLI tool.\nIntegrating Packit-as-a-Service into your project or organization from GitHub Marketplace  Navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Packit-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; GitHub application. Under \u0026ldquo;Pricing and setup\u0026rdquo;, click \u0026ldquo;Install it for free\u0026rdquo;. Click \u0026ldquo;Complete order and begin installation\u0026rdquo;. Install the \u0026ldquo;Packit-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; to repositories of your choice.  Once installed, you will see the \u0026ldquo;Packit-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; GitHub application in your project settings. In the left sidebar, click \u0026ldquo;Integration \u0026amp; services\u0026rdquo; and you will see the application displayed there.\nIn order to continue, please head to the main Packit guide.\nHow to check Packit Service works in your project? Currently, Packit Service is able only to build your changes and provide them as RPMs. Once you create a pull request, Packit Service builds the code from the pull request in COPR repository and reports back COPR build status to the pull request.\nAn example of Packit Service pull request:\nHow to re-trigger Packit Service actions in your pull request? Packit Service is able to schedule new builds based on a pull request comment:\n/packit copr-build  So whenever you run into a flake or feel like you want to retrigger, just type that comment into the PR and enjoy some fine, fresh builds.\nOnly project collaborators can re-trigger.\nHow to propose a new downstream update? Packit Service is able to propose updates of new upstream releases using this comment in an issue:\n/packit propose-update  If you want to propose the latest release into Fedora repositories, create an issue and add that comment into this issue and Packit service triggers and pushes it directly into Fedora dist-git repositories.\nIf all jobs (propose_downstream), defined in packit.yaml file, finished successfully, then the issue is automatically closed.\nOnly project collaborators can propose a new update.\nAdding tests It is also possible to run tests against the freshly built rpms. See the Testing Farm documentation for details.\n"

	"content": "Our sprint nears an end which means we have released a new version of packit - 0.2.0! You can expect a new release after every sprint (i.e. every 2 weeks).\nThe 0.2.0 version has a bunch of new features and improvements: you can find a complete list in the changelog. We also have a detailed documentation for all the workflows packit covers.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get through what\u0026rsquo;s new:\n We have decided to rename two keys in our config file so they are more descriptive. Old names still work but they are deprecated:  package_name → downstream_package_name upstream_name → upstream_project_name  You don\u0026rsquo;t need to touch dist-git at all when getting your new upstream release into Fedora, you can stay in your upstream repository and just fire off a bunch of packit calls:  packit propose-update to create a pull request in Fedora dist-git with the selected upstream release packit build to build the new upstream release once the pull request is merged and finally, packit create-update creates a new bodhi update (if you chose a stable Fedora release)  Packit now has a srpm command which creates an SRPM out of the local content of your upstream repository. You can now use packit to sync files from your dist-git repo back into upstream (mainly to keep spec files in sync). sync-from-downstream is the command. Command propose-update received numerous improvements:  You can pick upstream version to use. Packit will NOT check out the git ref with the upstream release if you specify --local-content It\u0026rsquo;s possible to force packit to execute fedpkg new-sources using --force-new-sources and bypass the caching mechanism.   Installation Please make sure you are installing 0.2.0:\n$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit  Or\n$ pip3 install --user packitos  You can also install packit from master branch, if you are brave enough:\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit  How are we using packit? I\u0026rsquo;d like to show you how we used packit to bring a new upstream release of ogr into Fedora, a library which packit is using.\nOnce we have performed an upstream release of ogr, we can propose an update in dist-git:\n$ git clone https://github.com/packit-service/ogr \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd ogr/ $ packit propose-update INFO: Running 'anitya' versioneer Version in upstream registries is '0.0.3'.

	"content": " Agenda Being fully on-board of the packit train may take some time and effort. This is why we decided to split the on-boarding process into multiple checkpoints:\n Have packit tooling installed locally. RPM builds pass on your laptop. You are approved to use packit-service. The project has successful builds inside the service. Packit service handles Fedora Rawhide updates for you.  The guide We welcome all the suggestions to this guide, feel free to open a new issue here.\nHave packit tooling installed locally. In order to start using packit, it\u0026rsquo;s a best practice to install the tooling locally. All the logic is baked inside packit command - so once packit srpm (the command to create a source RPM locally from the current snapshot of the project) starts passing for you, it\u0026rsquo;s very likely it will work inside the packit service as well.\nThis is how you can install packit if you are on Fedora Linux:\n$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit  We publish packit to PyPI and it\u0026rsquo;s available as packitos project — packit at PyPI is something different\n$ pip3 install --user packitos  You can also help us test the latest development snapshot by installing packit directly from the master branch:\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit  RPM builds pass on your laptop. Once you install packit locally, it\u0026rsquo;s time to fill .packit.yaml — the configuration file packit is using.\nThe documentation file has a document on its own: configuration.\nPackit supports actions and hooks: you can define commands on your own which would replace packit\u0026rsquo;s implementation (e.g. get version, or create a tarball) or run specific commands after the upstream repo is cloned. Please read more about actions here: actions.\nPackit needs an RPM spec file to build your package. The spec file does not need to be included in the upstream repo and can be generated on the fly or downloaded (e.g. from Fedora dist-git). Please check out our FAQ to read about some other common questions.\nYou can also read more about the SRPM process in the document dedicated to the srpm command.\nIs your packit srpm finally passing? If not, feel free to reach out to us. If yes, let\u0026rsquo;s proceed to the next level.\nRunning from the dist-git repository When you are not allowed or do not want to run packit command from the upstream git repository, you can run commands from the cloned dist-git repository in the same way as you do from upstream. Make sure, that you specify the upstream_project_url in your configuration.\nYou are approved to use packit-service. In order to start using packit service, the killer GitHub app, you need to install it in your GitHub projects. Then we need to approve you (usually takes only a few hours).\nThis process is described in detail over here.\nThe project has successful builds inside the service. If a SRPM can be created locally, all should be good in the service as well. That\u0026rsquo;s the theory. In practice, your laptop and packit service sandbox environment are vastly different. One thing which can happen easily is that a command is not available in the sandbox. Also, all the commands are ran using an unprivileged user - you can\u0026rsquo;t install anything or perform any privileged operation. In any case, feel free to reach out to us if you are having troubles and we\u0026rsquo;d be glad to help.\nIn order to get RPM builds for every change in your project, you need add a section jobs inside your .packit.yaml and set up a job to do RPM builds for every change in a PR:\njobs: - job: copr_build trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - fedora-29-x86_64 - fedora-30-x86_64 - fedora-rawhide-x86_64  Jobs are nicely described over here.\nIf you are looking for an inspiration for your .packit.yaml, check packit\u0026rsquo;s config file since we try to use all the latest features.\nPackit service handles Fedora Rawhide updates for you. So you already have jobs section in your config.

Packit enables you to decide whether you want to do a direct push or create a pull request:\n If you want direct pushes, you need to set a global config option create_pr to false:\ncreate_pr: false jobs: - job: propose_downstream trigger: release metadata: dist-git-branch: master  Packit user in Fedora is not a proven packager, so you need to grant packit user the ability to push.\n Creating pull requests is easy. create_pr defaults to true so the config starting this section is good enough.\n  "

	"content": "Source git is the place where the manual work is done This document serves as a detailed description of source-git. Please bear in mind that some things are a subject to change — the overall design is pretty solid, but details may be tinkered over time.\nAuthors: Stef Walter, Tomas Tomecek\nTL;DR Content of source-git repository is equivalent to dist-git, but uses upstream format: source files instead of tarballs, git commits instead of patches.\nYou can host this repository, or the specific git branch, anywhere you want. If you open a pull request, you will receive feedback on the changes:\n Does the package build with the changes? Do all the package tests pass? How about tests of the dependant packages? Are the changes good to be included in Fedora?  The goal of packit is to provide automation and tooling to interact with source-git repositories so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to touch dist-git ever again. Our plan is to center development experience around upstream repositories and source-git.\nUpstream repositories and source-git repositories are pretty much the same thing. Creating source-git only makes sense when the upstream does not accept downstream spec file or adding spec file to such a project doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense.\nFull description Source git becomes the place for creative and interesting work, including aspects of packaging requiring human effort. We allow dist-git to become an auto-maintained location, used for tracking the current state of Fedora, rather than the place where any actual development happens.\nBecause source git is the location for creative work, we can use modern tooling, GitHub, GitLab, Pagure, pull requests, code review, continuous integration and other modern development workflows.\nIn many cases source git can be the upstream project git itself (mostly with projects where downstream maintainer is also the upstream maintainer). In other cases source git can be a fork of upstream git (such as with the Linux kernel).\nWe take cues from projects that already do this. We use the distributed nature of git repositories to overcome obstacles where certain parts of a package (patches, spec, tests) can not (due to embargoes/secrets) or will not (due the upstream project) be included in the upstream source git.\nBots are perfect candidates to perform the mundane tasks of auto-maintaining dist-git. Whenever a bot gets stuck, it can always ask maintainer for help (or the maintainer can perform the action for the bot).\nPremises One of the fundamentally useless manual activities when a maintaining a package in Fedora is moving code from one git repository format to another. a) git is distributed b) dist-git content is mostly boilerplate or regurgitated data.\nLinux distributions gain an advantage from having patches incorporated upstream and not carrying them downstream.\nHuman effort should not be focused on repetitive automatible tasks related to churn and moving code around.\nDist-git is used as a store of state for build tools (like koji). Reinventing dist-git itself fundamentally, means reinventing a lot of tooling.\nPrinciples Dist-git tracks the inputs for and source state of a package build in Fedora. It is not a place for development. It is the place where integration happens.\nA Dist-git branch may diverge from the stable state of a Fedora release. The stable state is represented by which builds were tagged into the stable compose, not by what is in dist-git.\nAim to do Fedora development of a package in source git. Either directly in upstream or in downstream git forks and branches of the upstream (see the kernel for longest running example of this).\nAny repetitive task, whether repetitive for a single package, or repetitive across packages should be owned by bots auto-maintaining dist-git. Any creative non-automatable human task should be done in source git.\nWe are starting this project open source from the beginning.\nAcceptance Criteria In the ideal path, dist-git should be completely automatically “maintained” (already done to varying extents in the kernel, systemd, cockpit, ostree, conu, colin and other packages).\nIt must be trivially possible to opt in and out of auto-maintenance for a given dist-git branch.\nIt should continue to be possible for a human to fix up a dist-git branch, in cases where a task was done incorrectly by a bot. Bots may overwrite such fixups.\nEach auto-maintained dist-git branch tracks a branch in a source git repository. The source git branch should share a common git history with the upstream project branches if maintainer desires such functionality.\nEach time the HEAD of the git source branch changes, a process is started to update dist-git to reflect those changes. This process may also be triggered manually via a tool. If the dist-git is not in an expected state (last commit is not from the bot), the bot should report such divergence.\nOnly the most recent signed commit is a candidate for pulling into dist-git.\nSource code and patches are pulled from source git branch:\n The source code is the git source branch itself. The latest git tag of the git source branch is treated as the release. It must be possible to ignore certain tag patterns. Any commits after that tag in the git source branch are treated as additional patches to be distributed. In order to turn it into an SRPM and include it into dist-git it may be automatically turned into a tarball via an archive command on its latest tag. It must also be possible to use released tarballs from a project if available and necessary for a given dist-git repository, and layer patch files on top in dist-git.  Spec files are pulled from source:\n In the ideal case a spec file is maintained upstream in the same git repository as the source code. This is similar to how many projects have a Dockerfile. When upstream does not accept a spec file, it should be placed as an additional commit in the source git branch, and carried as if it were a patch. To allow trivial revert, review and merge workflows, the release number of the spec file is automatically generated (eg: SuSE and OBS). The release number should be present in the SRPM file name and contents. %changelog in an SRPM is automatically generated from the commits in source git repository. Various techniques may be used to collapse history. Project specific tooling in the source git repo can be used to generate the spec file (eg: as seen today in the kernel). We must provide reference implementation of such script. A spec file can be auto-generated for new packages, and reviewed by a human, who can do FIXUPs.  See: https://github.com/clearlinux/autospec   Tests are pulled from source:\n Components of the operating system have integration and acceptance tests. In the ideal case these are maintained upstream in the given project. They are treated similar to source code. When an upstream does not accept a test, it should be placed as an additional commit in the branch of the git source repository, and carried as if it was a patch. Tests should be wrapped in such a way that anyone can easily (2 commands at most) execute them locally and iterate on them with good velocity. These tests need to pass in order the component to be included in a compose.  After a bot makes a change to dist-git it automatically triggers the koji build.\nThe build in koji is validated that it works with the rest of the operating system packages in that branches compose. If it does it is then tagged into the compose.\nWhen validation fails, feedback goes back to the upstream project. At an absolute minimum the owner of the source git change. But it must be possible to send feedback to a minimal set of Git Forges (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).\nInstead of configuring the bots globally, the bot entry points (configuration) should live in the dist-git repositories (or source-git). The entry points may contain package specific code and variables that can affect the bot implementation for that repository.\nManual activities take place on source git. Humans may be involved in:\n Investigation of build, test, or packaging failures Material changes to spec files Material changes to test wrappers Writing documentation that describe the new changes Changes to packaging and delivery policy  We must get credentials for the bots to perform these activities. We must implement metering in the beginning to prevent bots going wild across the entire dist-git repository.\nAny change to the bots must self-validate by comparing recent bot behavior on recently changed dist-git repositories, and seeing if they have similar behavior.\nSpecifications and Interfaces Configuration in dist-git In order to automate dist-git and pull from source git, an extensible configuration file would be placed in dist-git (or source-git).\nPlacing this config in a branch in dist-git indicates that that dist-git branch should be auto-maintained. The config may be removed to turn off auto-maintenance. There is one config per auto-maintained branch, e.g. a config in f28 dist-git branch implies the branch is auto-maintained and points to specific source git branch.\nIt should at a minimum support:\n Which source git repository to pull from. Which branch in that source git repository to pull from. Optional: A container to do dist-git population with Defaults to the ‘default’ container (see below) Optional: An expression that describes how to parse tags in source git as versions This can be completely overridden by the container (see below) Eg: v4.9-rc8 -\u0026gt; 4.9 Optional: Which Koji buildroots to build in Defaults to the one decided by fedpkg Optional: GPG key ids considered valid for signing packages.  Source git best practices New upstream releases will result in new source-git branches. We can\u0026rsquo;t rebase existing branches since we would lose the provenance.\nThe diagram showcases how upstream releases (git tags) correspond to source git dist-git branches. New releases are automatically detected and proposed as a pull request. Once the packaging is completed, new corresponding branch is created and the new release should land in a continuously development (cont-dev) branch. Please bear in mind, that in order for a pull request to be merged, it needs to pass all the validation. Therefore in order for the 1.1.0 upstream release to land in the 1.1.0 source git branch, all the tests have to pass.\nIt’s up to a maintainer then to cherry-pick which changes should land in a selected downstream dist-git branch.\nPopulation of dist-git The actual population of dist-git and source git. Specification of the population process:\n The input, checked out source git will be placed in a known path. The container should process the input and place it to a well known path. The container image can live in any registry. Every maintainer will be able to create a container image to perform the population on their own, given it follows the specification.  After the population process is done, the bot collects the output, performs a commit, signs it and pushes to dist-git.\nThese two population mechanisms (=container images) will be available to maintainers:\n Default: produce an archive out of the source git content. No patch files. Upstream tarball: Take upstream release tarball and lay additional commits as patches on top.  Use case: Cockpit (where tarball very diverged from git)   Signing of source git This is a description of the initial proposal to perform signing of commits. Our expectation is that the design will evolve over time.\nThe HEAD commit on the tracked branch in source git, which represents the content to land in dist-git (see above), must be signed. When new commits are pushed to source git, a bot checks signatures used to sign those commits. The signature IDs which are approved to push to dist-git need to be specified in a configuration file placed in dist-git. If the signature ID is not in the configuration file, the commit is not synced and the bot notifies owners of the source git repository.\nWorkflow:\n A new signed commit is pushed to source git. A bot detects the commit, validates that it is signed using an approved signature.  If not, notifies maintainer to resolve the issue.  If the signature is valid, the bot prepares population of dist-git.  It uses the mechanism described in in previous section “Population of dist-git”. Before pushing to dist-git, the bot signs the commit with its own key. The bot also references the respective source git commit(s).  The commit is pushed to dist-git.  Summary: all commits in dist-git, which are curated by a bot, are signed with bot’s key. The commit message then references the commits in source git. All the mentioned commits need to be signed so it’s possible to figure out who authored and approved the work.\n"

This job only makes sure the changes happen in Fedora dist-git - no builds. The global key create_pr controls whether a pull request is created or changes are pushed directly.\nSupported triggers: release.\nOptional metadata:\n dist-git-branch - a branch in dist-git where packit should work (defaults to master)  Example\njobs: - job: propose_downstream trigger: release - job: propose_downstream trigger: release metadata: dist-git-branch: f30  This config would update Fedora Rawhide and Fedora 30 dist-git branches.\nUser configuration file When running packit as a tool locally, it is convenient to use a configuration file to provide data such as API tokens. Packit respects XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable. If not set, it looks inside ~/.config/ directory.\nThe acceptable names are the same as for the package config:\n .packit.yaml .packit.yml .packit.json packit.yaml packit.yml packit.json  Values    Key name Type Description     debug bool enable debug logs   dry_run bool Do not perform any remote changes (pull requests or comments)   fas_user string username in Fedora account system (to perform kinit if needed)   github_token string Github API token: this is needed when packit interacts with Github API: https://github.com/settings/tokens (getting full read \u0026amp; write repo scope should be enough)   pagure_user_token string Pagure token needed to access REST API, get it at: https://src.fedoraproject.org/settings#nav-api-tab    Specifying tokens as environment variables GITHUB_TOKEN and PAGURE_USER_TOKEN is now deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Please store the tokens in the config file.\nSince API tokens are a very sensitive information, please do NOT ever store them in a public (such as a GitHub repository). The configuration file here is located on your workstation, please do NOT confuse it with a config file for your project - that one is described above in the first section of this document.\nMinimal sample config debug: true github_token: mnbvcxz123456 pagure_user_token: qwertyuiop098765  Server-side configuration These values are used to configure packit service.

Test execution is configured via Flexible Metadata Format, according to the L1 Metadata and L2 Metadata specification.\nCurrently only a subset of the metadata specification is implemented: It is possible to run BeakerLib tests and arbitrary shell commands. See Examples and Support Matrix for more details.\nIf you are interested in Testing Farm\u0026rsquo;s architecture, see the section Architecture.\nUser Guide Add Tests Test configuration is stored directly in the project repository. Make sure that you have fmf package installed on your system. In order to start, initialize the metadata tree in the root directory of your git repository.\nfmf init  The initialization will create .fmf directory in your repository which you must add in your pull request otherwise Testing Farm will not find your tests.\nFor small projects store test config in a single ci.fmf file. If your config grows consider using elasticity to organize your config into multiple files. Here\u0026rsquo;s a minimal example showing how to enable a simple smoke test:\n/test/build/smoke: execute: how: shell commands: - /usr/bin/binary --help  The first line defines name of the test set. It is possible to define multiple testsets in the config to cover multiple scenarios. Tests can be fetched from a remote repository as well. Use the discover step to reference the remote repository:\n/test/build/smoke: discover: how: fmf repository: \u0026quot;https://github.com/systemd-rhel/tests\u0026quot; execute: how: beakerlib  Use custom filter in order to choose relevant tests only:\ndiscover: how: fmf filter: \u0026quot;tier: 1 \u0026amp; distros: rhel-8\u0026quot; repository: \u0026quot;https://github.com/systemd-rhel/tests\u0026quot;  The prepare step can be used to define how test environment should be prepared before testing. Currently only ansible playbooks are supported:\nprepare: how: ansible playbooks: - ci/rhel-8.yml  See the L2 Metadata specification for a detailed description of the individual test steps and the whole concept.\nEnable Testing In order to enable test execution simply include copr_build and tests jobs in the .packit.yaml configuration:\n... jobs: - job: copr_build trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - fedora-29-x86_64 - fedora-30-x86_64 - fedora-rawhide-x86_64 - job: tests trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - fedora-29-x86_64 - fedora-30-x86_64 - fedora-rawhide-x86_64  That\u0026rsquo;s it! Since now you should see testing feedback in your pull requests.\nRestart Testing The testing will be automatically started after an update to the pull request and successful copr build. To trigger retesting manually (can come handy in case of infrastructure issues for example), you can use the following comment in the pull request:\n/packit test  Support Matrix Currently supported steps and implementations:\n Discover: fmf Prepare: ansible Execute: shell, beakerlib  Test Environment We currently support running tests in an x86_64 virtual machine only. The system is using qemu-kvm with hardware acceleration. You have full root access in the machine. The test environment currently cannot be easily changed.\nAdditional machine specs:\n RAM: 2 GB HDD: 4 GB  Debugging and Reproducing We are working on an easy way how to develop new tests, debug and reproduce issues for failed runs. Until that is ready, your best option is to spin up a new Fedora Docker container or run the Fedora Cloud Base qcow2 manually via qemu-kvm or libvirt.

The meaning of individual attributes is as follows:\n Summary — an optional but useful attribute describing high-level purpose of the testset. Discover — instructs to fetch tests from given repository and select relevant ones by provided filter. Prepare — specifies which ansible playbook should be applied to prepare environment for testing. Execute — defines that the beakerlib framework should be used for running the tests.  FMF Tests Here\u0026rsquo;s a real-life example of tests enabled for the fmf package. There are several testsets defined under the testsets directory.

It consists of 4 main components. It\u0026rsquo;s source code is located under the testing-farm organization on gitlab.com.\nCurrently Testing Farm is deployed on Centos CI Openshift, where it runs it\u0026rsquo;s components and uses the same cluster as the testing infrastructure. See section Test Environment for more information about the test environment.\nComponents API API is a REST API endpoint used for integration with other services. Packit Service uses this API to trigger tests. For each trigger request the API runs a Worker on the cluster as a separate pod.\nThe Console component uses it to get the logs of the Workers. Each trigger request MUST contain a unique pipeline ID, generated by the requester, which identifies the request and result and is used to access the console and testing artifacts.\nThe API is currently in version 0 and it is expected to change.\nThe source code of the API is located in the testing-farm/api project.\nConsole Is a React.js application that uses API\u0026rsquo;s console endpoint to access the Worker\u0026rsquo;s pod console. Currently it is the main entrypoint for a user. Packit users can access the console by clicking the Details link in the Github PR test results.\nConsole provides also a link to produced test artifacts.\nThe source code of the Console is located in the testing-farm/console project.\nArtifacts Artifacts component provides access to the artifact storage to the end users. Artifacts are stored on a persistent volume storage which is shared with all the workers. Artifacts are not accessed directly, but via the Console.\nThe source code of the Artifacts is located in the testing-farm/artifacts project.\nWorker Worker is a container image which runs the testing workloads. Each worker is run in a separate pod.\nThe worker can be easily run from your localhost and if it has access to /dev/kvm, it can run basically the same workloads as CI. We will use it in the future to provide a seamless experience to the end users to reproduce the tests on your localhost.\nIf you want to try out worker now, you can easily run some tests from a repository with FMF tests with the command bellow.\npodman run --device /dev/kvm quay.io/testing-farm/cruncher cruncher --git-url https://github.com/packit-service/hello-world --keep-instance  The option --keep-instance will keep the VM reserved and you will be presented in the worker logs how to connect to the machine via ssh.\nThe source code of the Worker is located in the testing-farm/cruncher project.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": " This is a practical introduction to source-git using a real example.\nIf you are interested in the theory behind source-git, please read the specification.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a source-git repo I choose systemd from Fedora 29 for this example.\nWhat do we need? 3 things:\n Systemd upstream repo. Fedora 29 dist-git repo of systemd. New local git repo.  Let\u0026rsquo;s set all of this up. We\u0026rsquo;ll start with an empty git repository:\n$ mkdir systemd-source-git $ cd systemd-source-git $ git init . Initialized empty Git repository in /home/tt/t/systemd-source-git/.git/  We\u0026rsquo;ll add fedora and upstream remotes, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll fetch them:\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/systemd/systemd.git $ git remote add fedora ssh://ttomecek@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/rpms/systemd.git $ git fetch -q upstream $ git fetch -q fedora  Systemd also has a dedicated repository with backports to the older releases. This is how systemd is packaged in Fedora.\n$ git remote add upstream-stable https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable.git $ git fetch -q upstream-stable  We can start now Usually you would try to figure which upstream release is used so that you know what to choose for the base. But systemd in Fedora is not using the pristine upstream archives.\nWhen we open the Fedora 29 systemd spec file, we can see that upstream uses commit hash 8bca4621fc003a148c70248c55aa877dfe61fd3f for the upstream tarball from the systemd-stable repo. We\u0026rsquo;ll start a new git branch in our repo named 239-sg (sg as source-git):\n$ git checkout -B 239-sg 8bca4621fc003a148c70248c55aa877dfe61fd3f Switched to a new branch '239-sg'  Right now we have the upstream history which lead to the 239 release. Alternatively we could just unpack the upstream tarball and have the history in a single commit.\nIn this case, the upstream history is not marked in a any way, so let\u0026rsquo;s tag it:\n$ git tag upstream-239 HEAD  Packit will be able to distinguish between additional source-git content and upstream history.\nWe can start layering downstream content on top.\nLayering downstream content on top of upstream Let\u0026rsquo;s get files from the fedora/f29 branch.\n$ git checkout fedora/f29 -- . $ git status On branch 239-sg Changes to be committed: (use \u0026quot;git reset HEAD \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026quot; to unstage) modified: .gitignore new file: 0001-Revert-journald-periodically-drop-cache-for-all-dead.patch new file: 0998-resolved-create-etc-resolv.conf-symlink-at-runtime.patch new file: 20-grubby.install new file: 20-yama-ptrace.conf new file: inittab new file: purge-nobody-user new file: sources new file: split-files.py new file: sysctl.conf.README new file: systemd-journal-gatewayd.xml new file: systemd-journal-remote.xml new file: systemd-udev-trigger-no-reload.conf new file: systemd-user new file: systemd.spec new file: triggers.systemd new file: yum-protect-systemd.conf  We have a bunch of new files from f29 branch in the root. We\u0026rsquo;ll move them now to the fedora/ directory:\n$ mkdir fedora $ mv $(git diff --name-only --cached) fedora/  and we should also clean our working tree:\n$ git reset HEAD . Unstaged changes after reset: M .gitignore $ git checkout .gitignore  \u0026hellip;and commit the fedora content now:\n$ git add fedora  We don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit those two patch files:\n$ git reset HEAD fedora/0001-Revert-journald-periodically-drop-cache-for-all-dead.patch fedora/0998-resolved-create-etc-resolv.conf-symlink-at-runtime.patch  We can now commit the files in fedora/ directory:\n$ git commit -m 'add fedora packaging' [239-sg 20548da6d9] add fedora packaging 15 files changed, 2901 insertions(+) create mode 100644 fedora/.gitignore create mode 100755 fedora/20-grubby.install create mode 100644 fedora/20-yama-ptrace.conf create mode 100644 fedora/inittab create mode 100755 fedora/purge-nobody-user create mode 100644 fedora/sources create mode 100644 fedora/split-files.py create mode 100644 fedora/sysctl.conf.README create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-journal-gatewayd.xml create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-journal-remote.xml create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-udev-trigger-no-reload.conf create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-user create mode 100644 fedora/systemd.spec create mode 100644 fedora/triggers.systemd create mode 100644 fedora/yum-protect-systemd.conf  Applying downstream patches We are getting to the core of source-git: we work with code in it, not with patches. Hence we need to apply the downstream patches:\n$ git am fedora/0001-Revert-journald-periodically-drop-cache-for-all-dead.patch Applying: Revert \u0026quot;journald: periodically drop cache for all dead PIDs\u0026quot; $ git am fedora/0998-resolved-create-etc-resolv.conf-symlink-at-runtime.patch Applying: resolved: create /etc/resolv.conf symlink at runtime $ git log --oneline| head -n 2 bcc2c8a292 resolved: create /etc/resolv.conf symlink at runtime 1d39b39df9 Revert \u0026quot;journald: periodically drop cache for all dead PIDs\u0026quot;  And that\u0026rsquo;s it, this is our source-git repo! You can check it out over here.\nOnce we finish source-git related code in packit, you\u0026rsquo;d be able then to work exclusively in source-git, getting results from tests and other testing systems directly on pull requests.\nWrap up As you can see, it is a lot of work to create the source-git repo. We are planning on automating it — creating a dedicated command in packit.\nWe also have a bunch of packit code related to source-git already done, but the overall experience is not done end-to-end.\n"

	"content": " Can I use the packit service as soon as I install it into my repository? Thanks for your interest in Packit Service! In order to start using the service you need to be whitelisted, which is an action to be done by us. Once we put you on the whitelist, we\u0026rsquo;ll get in touch with you. We are now on-boarding Fedora contributors (with a Fedora Account System account).\nCan I use packit service for any GitHub repository? Since packit service builds your PRs in Fedora COPR build service, by using Packit-as-a-service, your software needs to comply with COPR rules. If any of these points are violated, we\u0026rsquo;ll remove the builds and may put you on a blacklist so you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use the service again.\nHow can I contact you? If you encounter a problem while using Packit-as-a-service, please open an upstream issue. In case of any other questions, feel free to contact us: user-cont-team@redhat.com.\nHow can I download RPM spec file if it is not part of upstream repository? If you do not want to have the RPM spec file in your upstream repository, you can download it in actions section.\nAdd actions section to your packit.yaml configuration file and download the spec file in a hook post_upstream_clone. Packit service has a limited set of commands available so please use wget or curl.\nThe configuration file with downloading the RPM spec file now looks like this:\nspecfile_path: packit.spec synced_files: - packit.spec - .packit.yaml upstream_package_name: packitos downstream_package_name: packit actions: post-upstream-clone: \u0026quot;wget https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/packit/raw/master/f/packit.spec\u0026quot;  I have a template of a spec file in my repo: can packit work with it? Yes!\nThe solution is, again, actions and hooks. Just render the spec after the upstream repo is cloned:\nspecfile_path: my-project.spec upstream_package_name: my-project-src downstream_package_name: my-project actions: post-upstream-clone: \u0026quot;make generate-spec\u0026quot;  Where the \u0026ldquo;generate-spec\u0026rdquo; make target could look like this:\ngenerate-spec: sed -e 's/@@VERSION@@/$(VERSION)/g' my-project.spec.template \u0026gt;my-project.spec  As a practical example, cockpit-podman project is using this functionality.\nCan I use CentOS Stream with packit service? Yes, you can! It\u0026rsquo;s very simple, just add centos-stream-x86_64 as a target for the copr_build job:\njobs: - job: copr_build trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - centos-stream-x86_64  After adding tests I see error \u0026lsquo;No FMF metadata found.\u0026rsquo; If you encounter this error when running tests via Testing Farm, it means you forgot to initialize the metadata tree with fmf init and include the .fmf directory in the pull request.

	"content": "Packit Packit provides tooling and automation to integrate upstream open source projects into Fedora operating system. Packit project is composed of two main components:\n packit, a CLI tool, which you can install locally and start using right away.\n Packit-as-a-Service, a GitHub app — it can provide you feedback on how is your project integrated with Fedora Operating System.\n  Feel free to jump into the guide for using packit.\nUpstream repository https://github.com/packit-service/packit\nContact You can find us at Freenode IRC channel #packit, or feel free to create an issue in any of our GitHub projects.\nWe are also available on this e-mail: user-cont-team@redhat.com.\nThe key principles of packit  Packit aims to make things easy and right. But if the default behavior is not the right for you, there is still a way around, but may not be that simple. For example you can use actions to replace default packit\u0026rsquo;s behavior with a script of yours.\n Reuse existing tools and services where it makes sense: don\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.\n You can consume packit in two forms:\n Packit tool can run on your laptop and you run commands you want. Packit service reacts to events and performs actions which you defined in your packit.yaml.  We don\u0026rsquo;t break backwards compatibility just like that.\n Packit has a deprecation policy:\n We can mark a behaviour as deprecated. Deprecated content can be removed or changed after at least 3 minor releases. Deprecated content is advertised in our changelog, printed in terminal or tracked in your issue tracker.  We care about artifacts which Fedora supports: at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s RPMs, modules and container images.\n Our initial focus is solely on RPMs.  Packit respects Fedora guidelines.\n We want latest content in Fedora Rawhide, but only if it works (the new content can be built and tests are passing).\n Any task done by the automation system must be able to be performed by a human when that is required. Packit service must be capable of recovering from such situation.\n Packit developers must be able to iterate on all parts packit (testing a change, merging a change, deploying to production) at a pace of at least every two weeks. To accomplish this, the release and validation processes are completely automated.\n All the tests are passing in CI systems for master branches for all our projects. No excuses.\n Contributions to packit must be possible by any developer, maintainer, tester, or other engineer. Any Fedora developer or tester should be able to reproduce a bot locally on their machine, given appropriate credentials.\n  Why packit?  Our intent is to bring downstream and upstream communities closer: provide feedback from downstream to upstream. (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Hello \u0026lt;upstream project Y\u0026gt;, your newest release doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in Fedora Rawhide, it breaks \u0026lt;Z\u0026gt;, here is a link to logs.\u0026rdquo;)\n We want to only merge, build and compose components which integrate well with the rest of the operating system. The biggest impact of such behavior will be on Fedora Rawhide and when working on a new Fedora release.\n Automatically pull and validate new upstream releases. This can be a trivial thing to do, why should maintainers waste their times on work which can be automated.\n Developing in dist-git is cumbersome. Editing patch files and moving tarballs around is not fun. Why not working with the source code itself? With source-git, you\u0026rsquo;ll have upstream git history and the dist-git content combined in a single repository.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s use modern development techniques such as pull requests, code review, modern git forges, automation and continuous integration. We have computers to do all the mundane tasks. Why we, as humans, should do such work?\n We want dist-git to be \u0026ldquo;a database of content in a release\u0026rdquo; rather a place to do actual work. On the other hand, you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to interact with dist-git the same way. We are not taking that away. Source-git is meant to be the modern, better alternative.\n  DevConf.cz \u0026ldquo;Auto-maintain your package\u0026rdquo; talk.\n"
