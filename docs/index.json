	"content": "You can probably find yourself in a situation where some part of the packit workflow needs to be tweaked for your package.\nPackit supports actions, a way to change default implementation for a command of your choice. Packit is able to execute more commands. Each action can accept a list of commands. By default, the commands are executed directly and not in a shell - if you need shell, just wrap your command like this: bash -c \u0026quot;my fancy $command | grep success\u0026quot;.\nAll the actions are also executed inside Packit-as-a-Service. The service creates a new sandbox environment where the command is ran.\nActions have a default behaviour which you can override, hooks don\u0026rsquo;t have any - hooks are a way for you to perform operations after packit does a specific event, e.g. clones an upstream repo.\nCurrently, these are the actions you can use:\npropose-update command     name working directory when run description     [hook] post-upstream-clone upstream git repo after cloning of the upstream repo (master) and before other operations    [hook] pre-sync upstream git repo after cloning and checkout to the correct (release) branch     prepare-files upstream git repo after cloning, checking out of both upstream and dist-git repos replace patching and archive generation    create-patches upstream git repo after sync of upstream files to the downstream replace patching    create-archive upstream git repo when the archive needs to be created replace the code for creating an archive    get-current-version upstream git repo when the current version needs to be found expect version as a stdout    Creating SRPM These applies to srpm command and building in COPR.\n    name working directory when run description     [hook] post-upstream-clone upstream git repo after cloning of the upstream repo (master) and before other operations     get-current-version upstream git repo when the current version needs to be found expect version as a stdout    create-archive upstream git repo when the archive needs to be created replace the code for creating an archive    create-patches upstream git repo after sync of upstream files to the downstream replace patching    fix-spec-file upstream git repo after creation of a tarball and before running rpmbuild command this action changes spec file to use the new tarball    create-archive - is expected to return a relative path to the archive - relative within the repository. If there are more steps, then one of them has to return the archive name.\nfix-spec-file — this action performs these 3 operations on a spec file:\n Replaces Source0 with a local path to the generated tarball Changes first %setup (or %autosetup) macro in %prep and adds -n so the generated tarball can be unpacked Changes %version  As an example how to use this, a package may define more Sources - in such a case, default implementation of fix-spec-file won\u0026rsquo;t be able to update %prep correctly. You can write a simple shell script and use sed to set the new Sources correctly, e.g. sed -i packaging/fedora/snapd.spec -e \u0026quot;s/https.*only-vendor.tar.xz/$correct_tarball_path/\u0026quot;\nEnvironment variables set by packit Additionally, packit sets a few env vars for specific actions\nfix-spec-file\nPACKIT_PROJECT_VERSION — current version of the project (coming from git describe) PACKIT_PROJECT_COMMIT — commit hash of the top commit PACKIT_PROJECT_ARCHIVE — expected name of the archive\ncreate-archive\nPACKIT_PROJECT_VERSION — current version of the project (coming from git describe) PACKIT_PROJECT_NAME_VERSION — current name and version of the project (coming from git describe)\n In your package config they can be defined like this:\nspecfile_path: package.spec synced_files: - packit.yaml - package.spec upstream_package_name: package downstream_package_name: package dist_git_url: https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/package.git actions: prepare-files: \u0026quot;make prepare\u0026quot; create-archive: - \u0026quot;make archive\u0026quot; - \u0026quot;ls\u0026quot; "

	"content": "We would like to announce general availability of the initial version of packit, titled \u0026lsquo;0.1.0\u0026rsquo;.\nSince this is our first release, we would like to ask you to be patient if you encounter any issues. We work hard on packit\u0026rsquo;s usability. If you feel like that packit is doing something weird or if anything is unclear, don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate and reach out to us by creating a new Github issue.\nThe initial release contains two commands:\n packit propose-update — Opens a pull request in dist-git for the latest upstream release of a selected repository. packit watch-releases — Watches events for all the upstream releases and performs propose-update for those who use packit.  Installation $ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit Or\n$ pip3 install --user packitos Or (if you\u0026rsquo;re brave)\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit Requirements Present features have strict requirements on the upstream projects:\n  You need to have a packit config file present in the upstream repo.\n  You need to have spec file present in the upstream repo.\n  This workflow is suitable for people who are both upstream and downstream maintainers of the particular project. If you don\u0026rsquo;t fit into that bucket, then packit might not be ready for you, yet. Please wait till we land more source-git related functionality into packit.\npropose-update I\u0026rsquo;m going to demonstrate this functionality on ogr, our library for git forges, which powers packit.\nIt was recently approved for Fedora, so we can use packit to bring the initial version of ogr into Fedora Rawhide, 30 and 29.\nDo we have everything?

	"content": "This is a practical introduction to source-git using a real example.\nIf you are interested in the theory behind source-git, please read the specification.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a source-git repo I choose systemd from Fedora 31 for this example.\nWhat do we need? 3 things:\n Systemd upstream repo. Fedora 31 dist-git repo of systemd. New local git repo.  Let\u0026rsquo;s set all of this up. We\u0026rsquo;ll start with an empty git repository:\n$ mkdir systemd-source-git $ cd systemd-source-git $ git init . Initialized empty Git repository in /home/tt/t/systemd-source-git/.git/ We\u0026rsquo;ll add fedora and upstream remotes, and then we\u0026rsquo;ll fetch them:\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/systemd/systemd.git $ git remote add fedora ssh://ttomecek@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/rpms/systemd.git $ git fetch -q upstream $ git fetch -q fedora Systemd also has a dedicated repository with backports to the older releases. This is how systemd is packaged in Fedora.\n$ git remote add upstream-stable https://github.com/systemd/systemd-stable.git $ git fetch -q upstream-stable We can start now When we open the Fedora 31 systemd spec file, we can see that upstream uses version 243.7. There\u0026rsquo;s a corresponding tag v243.7 in upstream-stable. We\u0026rsquo;ll start a new git branch in our repo named 2437-sg (sg as source-git):\n$ git switch -C 2437-sg v243.7 Switched to a new branch \u0026#39;2437-sg\u0026#39; Right now we have the upstream history which lead to the 243.7 release. Alternatively we could just unpack the upstream tarball and have the history in a single commit.\nLayering downstream content on top of upstream Let\u0026rsquo;s get files from the fedora/f31 branch.\n$ git checkout fedora/f31 -- . $ git status On branch 2437-sg Changes to be committed: (use \u0026#34;git restore --staged \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026#34; to unstage) modified: .gitignore new file: 0002-Revert-units-set-NoNewPrivileges-for-all-long-runnin.patch new file: 0998-resolved-create-etc-resolv.conf-symlink-at-runtime.patch new file: 20-grubby.install new file: 20-yama-ptrace.conf new file: 464a73411c13596a130a7a8f0ac00ca728e5f69e.patch new file: inittab new file: purge-nobody-user new file: sources new file: split-files.py new file: sysctl.conf.README new file: systemd-journal-gatewayd.xml new file: systemd-journal-remote.xml new file: systemd-udev-trigger-no-reload.conf new file: systemd-user new file: systemd.spec new file: triggers.systemd new file: yum-protect-systemd.conf We have a bunch of new files from f31 branch in the root. We\u0026rsquo;ll move them now to the fedora/ directory:\n$ mkdir fedora $ mv $(git diff --name-only --cached) fedora/ and we should also clean our working tree:\n$ git reset HEAD . Unstaged changes after reset: M .gitignore $ git restore .gitignore \u0026hellip;and commit the fedora content now:\n$ git add fedora We don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit those patch files:\n$ git restore --staged fedora/0002-Revert-units-set-NoNewPrivileges-for-all-long-runnin.patch fedora/0998-resolved-create-etc-resolv.conf-symlink-at-runtime.patch fedora/464a73411c13596a130a7a8f0ac00ca728e5f69e.patch We also (currently) have to remove them from the spec file. Packit will automatically generate patches from the additional commits and add them to the spec when generating a SRPM or proposing downstream update.\nWe can now commit the files in fedora/ directory:\n$ git commit -m \u0026#39;add fedora packaging\u0026#39; [2437-sg 578bda8d7d] add fedora packaging 15 files changed, 3077 insertions(+) create mode 100644 fedora/.gitignore create mode 100755 fedora/20-grubby.install create mode 100644 fedora/20-yama-ptrace.conf create mode 100644 fedora/inittab create mode 100755 fedora/purge-nobody-user create mode 100644 fedora/sources create mode 100644 fedora/split-files.py create mode 100644 fedora/sysctl.conf.README create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-journal-gatewayd.xml create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-journal-remote.xml create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-udev-trigger-no-reload.conf create mode 100644 fedora/systemd-user create mode 100644 fedora/systemd.spec create mode 100644 fedora/triggers.systemd create mode 100644 fedora/yum-protect-systemd.conf Applying downstream patches We are getting to the core of source-git: we work with code in it, not with patches. But first we need to instruct packit from which point in history start downstream patches. Add upstream_ref key into .packit.yaml:\nupstream_ref: 2437-sg-start Commit and tag it:\n$ git commit -am \u0026#34;upstream_ref -\u0026gt; .packit.yaml\u0026#34; $ git tag 2437-sg-start HEAD Now we can apply the downstream patches:\n$ git am fedora/464a73411c13596a130a7a8f0ac00ca728e5f69e.patch Applying: udev: use bfq as the default scheduler $ git am fedora/0002-Revert-units-set-NoNewPrivileges-for-all-long-runnin.patch Applying: Revert \u0026#34;units: set NoNewPrivileges= for all long-running services\u0026#34; $ git am fedora/0998-resolved-create-etc-resolv.conf-symlink-at-runtime.patch Applying: resolved: create /etc/resolv.conf symlink at runtime $ git log --oneline| head -n 3 5fc8885d47 resolved: create /etc/resolv.conf symlink at runtime 81c37ac6f6 Revert \u0026#34;units: set NoNewPrivileges= for all long-running services\u0026#34; d9f29507fe udev: use bfq as the default scheduler (This is not the case for systemd, but) If the patches are not in git format you need to apply them with patch:\n$ patch -p1 --verbose --fuzz=0 \u0026lt;fedora/some-fix.patch $ git commit -am \u0026#34;some fix\u0026#34; And that\u0026rsquo;s it, this is our source-git repo! You can check it out over here.\nWorking with source-git Run packit srpm and see that packit generates an upstream tarball plus downstream patches and puts everything along with a spec file into a SRPM. The same applies to propose-update, local-build or copr-build commands.\nAlternatively you can use --upstream-ref option instead of putting the upstream_ref into .packit.yaml\nWrap up As you can see, it is a lot of work to create the source-git repo. We are planning on automating it — creating a dedicated command in packit.\nWe also have a bunch of packit code related to source-git already done, but the overall experience is not done end-to-end.\n"

	"content": "Packit-as-a-Service is a GitHub App that helps you continuously ensure that your project work in Fedora OS.\nEasy to use Using Packit Service is very straightforward: add one config file to your repository together with the RPM spec file and you\u0026rsquo;re good to go.\nPackit Service validates your pull requests by building your software in Fedora OS. Once the builds are done, Packit lets you know how to install the RPMs inside your environment so you can try the changes before merging them.\nOptionally, Packit Service can run tests for the built software (i.e. copr builds) in all current Fedora OS releases via Testing Farm.\nPackit is also available as a CLI tool, so you can always try things locally on your own. Note that testing is not currently supported with the CLI tool.\nIntegrating Packit-as-a-Service into your project or organization from GitHub Marketplace  Navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Packit-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; GitHub application. Under \u0026ldquo;Pricing and setup\u0026rdquo;, click \u0026ldquo;Install it for free\u0026rdquo;. Click \u0026ldquo;Complete order and begin installation\u0026rdquo;. Install the \u0026ldquo;Packit-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; to repositories of your choice.  Once installed, you will see the \u0026ldquo;Packit-as-a-Service\u0026rdquo; GitHub application in your project settings. In the left sidebar, click \u0026ldquo;Integration \u0026amp; services\u0026rdquo; and you will see the application displayed there.\nIn order to continue, please head to the main Packit guide.\nHow to check Packit Service works in your project? Currently, Packit Service is able only to build your changes and provide them as RPMs. Once you create a pull request, Packit Service builds the code from the pull request in COPR repository and reports back COPR build status to the pull request.\nAn example of Packit Service pull request:\nHow to re-trigger Packit Service actions in your pull request? Packit Service is able to schedule new builds based on a pull request comment:\n/packit copr-build or the shorter version\n/packit build So whenever you run into a flake or feel like you want to retrigger, just type that comment into the PR and enjoy some fine, fresh builds.\nThe standard requirements for permissions still apply, so if you see this message\nOnly users with write or admin permissions to the repository can trigger Packit-as-a-Service it means the author of the pull request does not have commit access to the repository so the build cannot be scheduled. This is a perfect case for maintainers of the repository to post /packit build in the PR to get a build.\nHow to propose a new downstream update? Packit Service is able to propose updates of new upstream releases using this comment in an issue:\n/packit propose-update If you want to propose the latest release into Fedora repositories, create an issue and add that comment into this issue and Packit service triggers and pushes it directly into Fedora dist-git repositories.\nIf all jobs (propose_downstream), defined in packit.yaml file, finished successfully, then the issue is automatically closed.\nOnly users with write or admin permissions to the repository can propose a new update.\nAdding tests It is also possible to run tests against the freshly built rpms. See the Testing Farm documentation for details.\n"

You can expect a new release after every sprint (i.e. every 2 weeks).\nThe 0.2.0 version has a bunch of new features and improvements: you can find a complete list in the changelog. We also have a detailed documentation for all the workflows packit covers.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get through what\u0026rsquo;s new:\n We have decided to rename two keys in our config file so they are more descriptive. Old names still work but they are deprecated:  package_name → downstream_package_name upstream_name → upstream_project_name   You don\u0026rsquo;t need to touch dist-git at all when getting your new upstream release into Fedora, you can stay in your upstream repository and just fire off a bunch of packit calls:  packit propose-update to create a pull request in Fedora dist-git with the selected upstream release packit build to build the new upstream release once the pull request is merged and finally, packit create-update creates a new bodhi update (if you chose a stable Fedora release)   Packit now has a srpm command which creates an SRPM out of the local content of your upstream repository. You can now use packit to sync files from your dist-git repo back into upstream (mainly to keep spec files in sync). sync-from-downstream is the command. Command propose-update received numerous improvements:  You can pick upstream version to use. Packit will NOT check out the git ref with the upstream release if you specify --local-content It\u0026rsquo;s possible to force packit to execute fedpkg new-sources using --force-new-sources and bypass the caching mechanism.    Installation Please make sure you are installing 0.2.0:\n$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit Or\n$ pip3 install --user packitos You can also install packit from master branch, if you are brave enough:\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit How are we using packit?

	"content": "This document is focused on how packit treats a source-git repo.\nIf you are looking for the design concept of source-git, please head on here: docs/source-git-design\nIn short, the source-git concept is fairly simple - take an upstream repo and shove downstream content on top of it. Easy right?\nPackit is then able to work with such a repo and:\n  Create SRPMs\n  Sync the state into dist-git\n  And you are able to utilize all features of packit-service: builds on PRs, tests on those builds, update your package in Fedora.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s describe all of these in detail.\nUpstream git history or just an unpacked tarball? Your source-git repo can contain upstream git history if you want. Or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. The alternative is to unpack a tarball corresponding to an upstream release. This is really up to you and packit is able to work with both.\nThe key ingredient here is the config option upstream_ref. It tells packit the git ref which is supposed to match the archive specified in the spec file. All commits on top of this ref are treated either as:\n downstream patches downstream packaging  For downstream patches, packit creates a patch for each commit on top of upstream_ref. Downstream packaging changes are ignored in patch files since they can be directly committed to dist-git. You can control the ignore mechanism with config option patch_generation_ignore_paths.\nExample Let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at source-git repo for pacemaker package:\n$ git log --online bd12722 (HEAD -\u0026gt; c8s-test, origin/c8s-test, master) downstream packaging 7201e28 Refactor: controller: remove unused argument 91c557c Refactor: controller: convert active_op_t booleans to bitmask 2e90063 Refactor: controller: rename struct recurring_op_s to active_op_t 3ee90ce (tag: source-git-start) pacemaker-2.0.3 base We have 5 commits:\n bd12722 - top commit, contains a spec file so packit won\u0026rsquo;t create a patch file out of this one 7201e28 - the 3rd downstream patch 91c557c - the 2nd downstream patch 2e90063 - the 1st downstream patch 3ee90ce - the bottom commit, equals to an unpacked upstream tarball  packit.yaml has only two lines:\n$ cat .packit.yaml specfile_path: SPECS/pacemaker.spec upstream_ref: source-git-start As you can see, we are telling packit, that commit tagged as source-git-start indicates the barrier between upstream and downstream, in our case, it\u0026rsquo;s just a single commit with the upstream archive content, but it could have been the whole upstream git history.\nAdding changes So, how can one add new changes into a source-git repo? That\u0026rsquo;s simple - just commit them. If your repo is on GitHub (or another public forge), you can even force-push changes to achieve desired results with patches.\nThe important point with patch files is, that a commit which changes code (not downstream packaging) will be:\n converted into a patch file (using git format-patch) added to the spec file  Controlling the patch process With the process above you cannot name the patch file nor control where exactly should packit place the Patch123: 123.patch line in the specfile. There is a way though how you can do all of that yourself. You can set patch metadata in a commit message which packit will then read and take into account:\n patch_name — name of the patch (e.g. my-fancy.patch) present_in_specfile: — when set to true, it indicates the patch is set in the spec file so packit should not touch the spec file  packit parses the metadata as yaml, hence the colon syntax.\nExample:\nAuthor: Packit \u0026lt;packit\u0026gt; AuthorDate: Wed Aug 19 11:55:14 2020 +0000 Commit: Packit \u0026lt;packit\u0026gt; CommitDate: Wed Aug 19 11:55:14 2020 +0000 Apply patch drpm-0.3.0-workaround-ppc64le-gcc.patch patch_name: drpm-0.3.0-workaround-ppc64le-gcc.patch present_in_specfile: true --- src/CMakeLists.txt | 2 +- test/CMakeLists.txt | 12 +----------- 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 12 deletions(-) And this is how a corresponding spec file looks (shortened for brevity)\nName: drpm Version: 0.4.1 Release: 2.g959639c5%{?dist} URL: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/%{name} Source: %{url}/releases/download/%{version}/%{name}-%{version}.tar.bz2 # add workaround for gcc7 on ppc64le temporary before it's fixed in gcc # https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1420350 Patch1: drpm-0.3.0-workaround-ppc64le-gcc.patch %prep %autosetup -p1 Rebase or merge? The most common workflow in the world of open source development is to accept pull requests and have merge commits in the git history. If the PRs are not rebased against master before the merge, the history may go wild. Packit is able to work with such a state by creating an ephemeral branch with linear history and generate the patch files out of it. More info.\nPicking up latest upstream changes into your downstream source-git repo has multiple solutions and it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to pick the one which suits your workflow best:\n Rebase against upstream master branch (a.k.a. git pull --rebase upstream master). This solution implies that you are able to perform the force-push operation (e.g. Fedora and CentOS dist-git instances don\u0026rsquo;t allow force-pushes). Packit will not help you with the rebase process in any way and it\u0026rsquo;s up to you to complete the rebase. Create a new branch for every upstream release. No rebase needed — may require good branch hygiene since the number of branches can skyrocket. No dedicated help from packit again, you are running all the git commands. Merge upstream changes (a.k.a. git merge upstream/master). Does not alter existing git history, yet makes it more complicated.  Creating an SRPM The format between a source-git repo and the build system is a source RPM - SRPM. We can then take the file and build it locally, send it to koji or copr and we would get the result we want - a list of binary RPMs created from the SRPM.\nIn the end, you can create SRPM with packit\u0026rsquo;s srpm command:\n$ packit srpm SRPM: /home/tt/p/c/s/pacemaker/pacemaker-2.0.3-6.gbd127227.fc32.src.rpm How packit generates an SRPM from a source-git repo? These are the steps:\n Download archive specified in specfile\u0026rsquo;s Source directive. Create patch files from commits on top off upstream_ref where necessary. Bump release in the spec file. Generate new changelog entry in the spec file. Run rpmbuild and set paths so that rpmbuild can find patches, spec files, archive and additional sources.  Updating your package in Fedora In this chapter, we\u0026rsquo;d cover the \u0026ldquo;sync to dist-git\u0026rdquo; part listed above. When you use source-git to track a package in Fedora, the workflow is the same as if you were in an upstream repository:\n$ packit propose-update which creates a PR similar to this: src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/python-docker/pull-request/26.\n"

	"content": "Agenda Being fully on-board of the packit train may take some time and effort. This is why we decided to split the on-boarding process into multiple checkpoints:\n Have packit tooling installed locally. RPM builds pass on your laptop. You are approved to use packit-service. The project has successful builds inside the service. Packit service handles Fedora Rawhide updates for you.  The guide We welcome all the suggestions to this guide, feel free to open a new issue here.\nHave packit tooling installed locally. In order to start using packit, it\u0026rsquo;s a best practice to install the tooling locally. All the logic is baked inside packit command - so once packit srpm (the command to create a source RPM locally from the current snapshot of the project) starts passing for you, it\u0026rsquo;s very likely it will work inside the packit service as well.\nThis is how you can install packit if you are on Fedora Linux:\n$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit We publish packit to PyPI and it\u0026rsquo;s available as packitos project — packit at PyPI is something different\n$ pip3 install --user packitos You can also help us test the latest development snapshot by installing packit directly from the master branch:\n$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit/packit RPM builds pass on your laptop. Once you install packit locally, it\u0026rsquo;s time to fill .packit.yaml — the configuration file packit is using.\nThe documentation file has a document on its own: configuration.\nPackit supports actions and hooks: you can define commands on your own which would replace packit\u0026rsquo;s implementation (e.g. get version, or create a tarball) or run specific commands after the upstream repo is cloned. Please read more about actions here: actions.\nPackit needs an RPM spec file to build your package. The spec file does not need to be included in the upstream repo and can be generated on the fly or downloaded (e.g. from Fedora dist-git). Please check out our FAQ to read about some other common questions.\nYou can also read more about the SRPM process in the document dedicated to the srpm command.\nIs your packit srpm finally passing? If not, feel free to reach out to us. If yes, let\u0026rsquo;s proceed to the next level.\nRunning from the dist-git repository When you are not allowed or do not want to run packit command from the upstream git repository, you can run commands from the cloned dist-git repository in the same way as you do from upstream. Make sure, that you specify the upstream_project_url in your configuration.\nYou are approved to use packit-service. In order to start using packit service, the killer GitHub app, you need to install it in your GitHub projects. Then we need to approve you (usually takes only a few hours).\nThis process is described in detail over here.\nThe project has successful builds inside the service. If a SRPM can be created locally, all should be good in the service as well. That\u0026rsquo;s the theory. In practice, your laptop and packit service sandbox environment are vastly different. One thing which can happen easily is that a command is not available in the sandbox. Also, all the commands are ran using an unprivileged user - you can\u0026rsquo;t install anything or perform any privileged operation. In any case, feel free to reach out to us if you are having troubles and we\u0026rsquo;d be glad to help.\nIn order to get RPM builds for every change in your project, you need add a section jobs inside your .packit.yaml and set up a job to do RPM builds for every change in a PR:\njobs: - job: copr_build trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - fedora-all fedora-all stands for all currently available Fedora releases.\nJobs are nicely described over here.\nIf you are looking for an inspiration for your .packit.yaml, check packit\u0026rsquo;s config file since we try to use all the latest features.\nPackit service handles Fedora Rawhide updates for you. So you already have jobs section in your config. Let\u0026rsquo;s extend it with another job to push new upstream releases to Fedora rawhide.\njobs: - job: propose_downstream trigger: release metadata: dist-git-branch: master Pretty clear I\u0026rsquo;d say: when a new upstream release happens, propose it to dist-git master branch: Fedora Rawhide. Packit enables you to decide whether you want to do a direct push or create a pull request. If you want direct pushes, you need to set a global config option create_pr to false:\ncreate_pr: false jobs: - job: propose_downstream trigger: release metadata: dist-git-branch: master Packit user in Fedora is not a proven packager, so you need to grant packit user the ability to push.\nCreating pull requests is easy. create_pr defaults to true so the config starting this section is good enough.\n"

	"content": "Source git is the place where the manual work is done This document serves as a detailed description of source-git. Please bear in mind that some things are a subject to change — the overall design is pretty solid, but details may be tinkered over time.\nAuthors: Stef Walter, Tomas Tomecek\nTL;DR Content of source-git repository is equivalent to dist-git, but uses upstream format: source files instead of tarballs, git commits instead of patches.\nYou can host this repository, or the specific git branch, anywhere you want. If you open a pull request, you will receive feedback on the changes:\n Does the package build with the changes? Do all the package tests pass? How about tests of the dependant packages? Are the changes good to be included in Fedora?  The goal of packit is to provide automation and tooling to interact with source-git repositories so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to touch dist-git ever again. Our plan is to center development experience around upstream repositories and source-git.\nUpstream repositories and source-git repositories are pretty much the same thing. Creating source-git only makes sense when the upstream does not accept downstream spec file or adding spec file to such a project doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense.\nFull description Source git becomes the place for creative and interesting work, including aspects of packaging requiring human effort. We allow dist-git to become an auto-maintained location, used for tracking the current state of Fedora, rather than the place where any actual development happens.\nBecause source git is the location for creative work, we can use modern tooling, GitHub, GitLab, Pagure, pull requests, code review, continuous integration and other modern development workflows.\nIn many cases source git can be the upstream project git itself (mostly with projects where downstream maintainer is also the upstream maintainer). In other cases source git can be a fork of upstream git (such as with the Linux kernel).\nWe take cues from projects that already do this. We use the distributed nature of git repositories to overcome obstacles where certain parts of a package (patches, spec, tests) can not (due to embargoes/secrets) or will not (due the upstream project) be included in the upstream source git.\nBots are perfect candidates to perform the mundane tasks of auto-maintaining dist-git. Whenever a bot gets stuck, it can always ask maintainer for help (or the maintainer can perform the action for the bot).\nPremises One of the fundamentally useless manual activities when a maintaining a package in Fedora is moving code from one git repository format to another. a) git is distributed b) dist-git content is mostly boilerplate or regurgitated data.\nLinux distributions gain an advantage from having patches incorporated upstream and not carrying them downstream.\nHuman effort should not be focused on repetitive automatible tasks related to churn and moving code around.\nDist-git is used as a store of state for build tools (like koji). Reinventing dist-git itself fundamentally, means reinventing a lot of tooling.\nPrinciples Dist-git tracks the inputs for and source state of a package build in Fedora. It is not a place for development. It is the place where integration happens.\nA Dist-git branch may diverge from the stable state of a Fedora release. The stable state is represented by which builds were tagged into the stable compose, not by what is in dist-git.\nAim to do Fedora development of a package in source git. Either directly in upstream or in downstream git forks and branches of the upstream (see the kernel for longest running example of this).\nAny repetitive task, whether repetitive for a single package, or repetitive across packages should be owned by bots auto-maintaining dist-git. Any creative non-automatable human task should be done in source git.\nWe are starting this project open source from the beginning.\nAcceptance Criteria In the ideal path, dist-git should be completely automatically “maintained” (already done to varying extents in the kernel, systemd, cockpit, ostree, conu, colin and other packages).\nIt must be trivially possible to opt in and out of auto-maintenance for a given dist-git branch.\nIt should continue to be possible for a human to fix up a dist-git branch, in cases where a task was done incorrectly by a bot. Bots may overwrite such fixups.\nEach auto-maintained dist-git branch tracks a branch in a source git repository. The source git branch should share a common git history with the upstream project branches if maintainer desires such functionality.\nEach time the HEAD of the git source branch changes, a process is started to update dist-git to reflect those changes. This process may also be triggered manually via a tool. If the dist-git is not in an expected state (last commit is not from the bot), the bot should report such divergence.\nOnly the most recent signed commit is a candidate for pulling into dist-git.\nSource code and patches are pulled from source git branch:\n The source code is the git source branch itself. The latest git tag of the git source branch is treated as the release. It must be possible to ignore certain tag patterns. Any commits after that tag in the git source branch are treated as additional patches to be distributed. In order to turn it into an SRPM and include it into dist-git it may be automatically turned into a tarball via an archive command on its latest tag. It must also be possible to use released tarballs from a project if available and necessary for a given dist-git repository, and layer patch files on top in dist-git.  Spec files are pulled from source:\n In the ideal case a spec file is maintained upstream in the same git repository as the source code. This is similar to how many projects have a Dockerfile. When upstream does not accept a spec file, it should be placed as an additional commit in the source git branch, and carried as if it were a patch. To allow trivial revert, review and merge workflows, the release number of the spec file is automatically generated (eg: SuSE and OBS). The release number should be present in the SRPM file name and contents. %changelog in an SRPM is automatically generated from the commits in source git repository. Various techniques may be used to collapse history. Project specific tooling in the source git repo can be used to generate the spec file (eg: as seen today in the kernel). We must provide reference implementation of such script. A spec file can be auto-generated for new packages, and reviewed by a human, who can do FIXUPs.  See: https://github.com/clearlinux/autospec    Tests are pulled from source:\n Components of the operating system have integration and acceptance tests. In the ideal case these are maintained upstream in the given project. They are treated similar to source code. When an upstream does not accept a test, it should be placed as an additional commit in the branch of the git source repository, and carried as if it was a patch. Tests should be wrapped in such a way that anyone can easily (2 commands at most) execute them locally and iterate on them with good velocity. These tests need to pass in order the component to be included in a compose.  After a bot makes a change to dist-git it automatically triggers the koji build.\nThe build in koji is validated that it works with the rest of the operating system packages in that branches compose. If it does it is then tagged into the compose.\nWhen validation fails, feedback goes back to the upstream project. At an absolute minimum the owner of the source git change. But it must be possible to send feedback to a minimal set of Git Forges (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).\nInstead of configuring the bots globally, the bot entry points (configuration) should live in the dist-git repositories (or source-git). The entry points may contain package specific code and variables that can affect the bot implementation for that repository.\nManual activities take place on source git. Humans may be involved in:\n Investigation of build, test, or packaging failures Material changes to spec files Material changes to test wrappers Writing documentation that describe the new changes Changes to packaging and delivery policy  We must get credentials for the bots to perform these activities. We must implement metering in the beginning to prevent bots going wild across the entire dist-git repository.\nAny change to the bots must self-validate by comparing recent bot behavior on recently changed dist-git repositories, and seeing if they have similar behavior.\nSpecifications and Interfaces Configuration in dist-git In order to automate dist-git and pull from source git, an extensible configuration file would be placed in dist-git (or source-git).\nPlacing this config in a branch in dist-git indicates that that dist-git branch should be auto-maintained. The config may be removed to turn off auto-maintenance. There is one config per auto-maintained branch, e.g. a config in f28 dist-git branch implies the branch is auto-maintained and points to specific source git branch.\nIt should at a minimum support:\n Which source git repository to pull from. Which branch in that source git repository to pull from. Optional: A container to do dist-git population with Defaults to the ‘default’ container (see below) Optional: An expression that describes how to parse tags in source git as versions This can be completely overridden by the container (see below) Eg: v4.9-rc8 -\u0026gt; 4.9 Optional: Which Koji buildroots to build in Defaults to the one decided by fedpkg Optional: GPG key ids considered valid for signing packages.  Source git best practices New upstream releases will result in new source-git branches. We can\u0026rsquo;t rebase existing branches since we would lose the provenance.\nThe diagram showcases how upstream releases (git tags) correspond to source git dist-git branches. New releases are automatically detected and proposed as a pull request. Once the packaging is completed, new corresponding branch is created and the new release should land in a continuously development (cont-dev) branch. Please bear in mind, that in order for a pull request to be merged, it needs to pass all the validation. Therefore in order for the 1.1.0 upstream release to land in the 1.1.0 source git branch, all the tests have to pass.\nIt’s up to a maintainer then to cherry-pick which changes should land in a selected downstream dist-git branch.\nPopulation of dist-git The actual population of dist-git and source git. Specification of the population process:\n The input, checked out source git will be placed in a known path. The container should process the input and place it to a well known path. The container image can live in any registry. Every maintainer will be able to create a container image to perform the population on their own, given it follows the specification.  After the population process is done, the bot collects the output, performs a commit, signs it and pushes to dist-git.\nThese two population mechanisms (=container images) will be available to maintainers:\n Default: produce an archive out of the source git content. No patch files. Upstream tarball: Take upstream release tarball and lay additional commits as patches on top.  Use case: Cockpit (where tarball very diverged from git)    Signing of source git This is a description of the initial proposal to perform signing of commits. Our expectation is that the design will evolve over time.\nThe HEAD commit on the tracked branch in source git, which represents the content to land in dist-git (see above), must be signed. When new commits are pushed to source git, a bot checks signatures used to sign those commits. The signature IDs which are approved to push to dist-git need to be specified in a configuration file placed in dist-git. If the signature ID is not in the configuration file, the commit is not synced and the bot notifies owners of the source git repository.\nWorkflow:\n A new signed commit is pushed to source git. A bot detects the commit, validates that it is signed using an approved signature.  If not, notifies maintainer to resolve the issue.   If the signature is valid, the bot prepares population of dist-git.  It uses the mechanism described in in previous section “Population of dist-git”. Before pushing to dist-git, the bot signs the commit with its own key. The bot also references the respective source git commit(s).   The commit is pushed to dist-git.  Summary: all commits in dist-git, which are curated by a bot, are signed with bot’s key. The commit message then references the commits in source git. All the mentioned commits need to be signed so it’s possible to figure out who authored and approved the work.\n"

	"content": "Packit uses a configuration file in the upstream repository. The config file is written in YAML language.\nYou should place the file in the root of your upstream repo. Packit accepts these names:\n .packit.yaml .packit.yml .packit.json packit.yaml packit.yml packit.json  Both Packit-as-a-Service and packit tool use this configuration file.\nTop level keys specfile_path (string) Relative path to a spec file within the upstream repository. If not specified, defaults to:\n downstream_package_name.spec if downstream_package_name is set. Else recursively search the tree and use the first spec file found.  upstream_project_name (string) Deprecated since packit-0.7.0, use upstream_package_name instead.\nupstream_package_name (string) Name of the upstream repository (e.g. in PyPI), defaults to the name of the Github repository; this is used in %prep section to generate an archive.\nupstream_project_url (string) URL of the upstream project (e.g. https://github.com/packit/packit).\ncreate_pr (bool) When doing a new update in Fedora dist-git, should packit create a new pull request (defaults to true) or push directly to dist-git (if set to false).\nsynced_files (list of strings or dicts) A list of relative paths to files in the upstream repo which are meant to be copied to dist-git during an update (spec file path and config file path are set every time by default).\nupstream_ref (string) Git reference to last upstream git commit (for source-git repos). Can be set to commit hash, tag or a branch name. You can also use globbing pattern to find a tag. In case you want to use globbing pattern for a branch, prefix the pattern with branches/, e.g. for a branch matching *-release set to branches/*-release.\ndownstream_package_name (string) Name of the RPM package in Fedora, defaults to the name of the Github repository.\ndist_git_namespace (string) Namespace in dist-git URL (defaults to \u0026ldquo;rpms\u0026rdquo;).\ndist_git_base_url (string) URL of dist-git server, defaults to https://src.fedoraproject.org/ (has to end with a slash).\ncreate_tarball_command (list of strings) A command which generates upstream tarball in the directory with the specfile (defaults to git archive -o \u0026quot;{specfile_dir}/{package_name}-{version}.tar.gz\u0026quot; --prefix \u0026quot;{package_name}-{version}/\u0026quot; HEAD).\ncurrent_version_command (list of strings) A command which prints current upstream version (hint: git describe) (defaults to git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match '*').\nactions (string) Custom actions/hooks overwriting the default behavior of packit (more in Actions).\njobs (list of dicts) A list of job definitions for packit service: see below for details.\nallowed_gpg_keys (list of string) A list of gpg-key fingerprints; if specified, one of the configured keys have to sign the last commit when updating in downstream; add GitHub key (5DE3E0509C47EA3CF04A42D34AEE18F83AFDEB23) if you want to use this on code merged via GitHub web interface.\nspec_source_id (int or string) Numeric ID of Source inside spec file which packit should change when setting path to the newly generated tarball, can be also full name of the macro. Defaults to Source0 or Source, whichever is found first in the spec file.\nupstream_tag_template (string) Packit by default expects git tags to match versions (e.g. when doing the propose-update command) - if you are using a different tagging scheme, let\u0026rsquo;s say v1.2.3 you can then set this parameter to v{version} and packit will fill in the version argument.\npatch_generation_ignore_paths (list of strings) In a source-git repo, when packit is generating patches, it excludes changes to the spec file and packit.yaml by default: with this option you can precisely specify paths to exclude.\nnotifications There is only one notifcation configuration you can set up right now: disable the \u0026ldquo;Congratulations!\u0026rdquo; comment which packit sends after a successful build of a pull request is done.\nThe default behaviour is to send the comment with instructions how to install a package with the change implemented in the pull request:\nnotifications: pull_request: successful_build: true You can disable the commenting by setting successful_build to false.\nMinimal sample config This is a sample config which is meant for packit itself.\n# packit is named packitos on PyPI b/c packit name was already taken upstream_package_name: packitos More examples of synced_files synced_files: # copy a file from root of the upstream repo to dist-git - packit.spec # if you copy packit.yaml downstream, you can then take advantage of # `sync-from-downstream` command - .packit.yaml # src: a file in root of the upstream repository # dest: path within the downstream repository - src: packit.spec dest: redhat/packit.spec # also supports globbing: copy everything from fedora-packaging folder and # put it to the root of the dist-git repo - src: fedora-packaging/* dest: . # you can specify multiple source files as well: - src: - package.spec - some-file dest: . Packit-as-a-Service As of July 2019, packit service doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any web interface, so the only way to change its behaviour is via the config file you just read about.\nWhen you open a pull request against your upstream repository, packit service picks up configuration file from your pull request, not from the branch against the PR is opened. This way, you can polish your .packit.yaml and see the results right away. (for more info, please see packit-service#48)\nPackit service jobs Once the service starts handling events of your repository, it needs to have a clear definition of what it should do.\nThe tasks the packit service should do are defined in section jobs. The section is a list of dicts:\njobs: - {key: value} - {} If there is no jobs section in the configuration file, jobs default to:\njobs: - job: tests trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: fedora-stable - job: propose_downstream trigger: release metadata: dist_git_branches: fedora-all If you do not want to use the jobs then the jobs section in the configuration file should be empty:\njobs: [] Every job has two mandatory keys:\n job - name of the job (you can imagine this as a CLI command) trigger - what is the trigger for the job?  Every job only supports a specific set of triggers.\nJobs can also accept additional configuration in a key metadata which has dict as a value:\njobs: - job: some-job trigger: ran-out-of-beer metadata: key: value Overriding global parameters You are able to override your global parameters (such as specfile_path, downstream_package_name, actions\u0026hellip;) for every job. This is very useful when you want to set up a build or a test matrix using different parameters or configuration. It\u0026rsquo;s also useful when your release workflow differs between Fedora and EPEL.\nIn order to do such a thing, just set a value you want to override in the respective job.\nExample:\nspecfile_path: package.spec jobs: - job: some-job trigger: ran-out-of-beer metadata: key: value specfile_path: somewhere/else/package.spec In this example, the job some-job would override specfile_path to somewhere/else/package.spec instead of using ./package.spec.\nSupported jobs copr_build\nCreate a SRPM and submit an RPM build to Fedora COPR build system.\nSupported triggers:\n pull_request \u0026ndash; check out content of the pull request commit \u0026ndash; reacts to new commits to the specified branch release \u0026ndash; check out content of the tag associated with the release  Required metadata:\n targets - a (list of) mock chroot(s) where to build (if you navigate to settings of your COPR project, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able able to see the list of available values, alternatively you can install package copr-cli in Fedora and see the list via copr-cli list-chroots. You can use fedora-development, fedora-stable and fedora-all aliases as a target. By default, the x86_64 architecture will be used, but you can use e.g. fedora-stable-aarch64 if you need. branch - the name of the branch we want to build for when using commit trigger  Optional metadata:\n timeout - (seconds) give up watching a build after timeout, defaults to 7200s, i.e. 2 hours owner - a namespace in Copr where the build should happen (defaults to packit) project - a name of the Copr project (defaults to \u0026quot;{github_namespace}-{repository_name}-{pr_id}\u0026quot;) additional_repos - a list of additional buildroot repositories list_on_homepage \u0026ndash; The project will be shown on Copr frontend homepage if set to True. Defaults to False. The value is represented as unlisted_on_hp in Copr project settings. preserve_project \u0026ndash; The project will not be removed after 60 days if set to True. Defaults to False. The value is represented as delete_after_days in Copr project settings (True is -1 and False is 60).  For custom owner, you will be asked to give us builder permission and in case of settings change (e.g. targets) also for admin permission. (You need to approve this request in the Copr project settings.) If you do not want to give us admin permission, you can do the change in Copr settings manually. Boolean values (list_on_homepage and preserve_project) are not updated when you use custom owner.\nExample\njobs: - job: copr_build trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - fedora-stable - centos-stream-x86_64 With this configuration, you\u0026rsquo;ll get builds in all stable fedora releases (excluding rawhide) and the CentOS stream.\nproduction_build (in preview, no reporting yet)\nCreate a SRPM and submit an RPM build to Fedora Koji build system.\nSupported triggers:\n pull_request \u0026ndash; check out content of the pull request commit \u0026ndash; reacts to new commits to the specified branch release \u0026ndash; check out content of the tag associated with the release  Required metadata:\n branch \u0026ndash; the name of the branch we want to build for when using commit trigger  Optional metadata:\n targets \u0026ndash; a (list of) targets we want to build for, list of supported targets can be listed using with koji list-targets scratch \u0026ndash; defaults to false, use to create scratch (test) builds instead of the real production builds  sync_from_downstream\nPick up a change (mass rebuild, proven packager rebuild or a fix) from Fedora dist-git and send it to upstream repository.\nSupported triggers: commit.\nExample\njobs: - job: sync_from_downstream trigger: commit propose_downstream\nLand a new upstream release in Fedora. This job only makes sure the changes happen in Fedora dist-git - no builds. The global key create_pr controls whether a pull request is created or changes are pushed directly.\nSupported triggers: release.\nOptional metadata:\n dist-git-branches - a (list of) branch(es) in dist-git where packit should work (defaults to master). You can also use fedora-development, fedora-stable and fedora-all aliases to not need to change the config file when the new system version is released.  Example\njobs: - job: propose_downstream trigger: release - job: propose_downstream trigger: release metadata: dist_git_branches: f32 This config would update Fedora Rawhide and Fedora 32 dist-git branches.\ntests\nSee more about tests here.\nUser configuration file When running packit as a tool locally, it is convenient to use a configuration file to provide data such as API tokens. Packit respects XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable. If not set, it looks inside ~/.config/ directory.\nThe acceptable names are the same as for the package config:\n .packit.yaml .packit.yml .packit.json packit.yaml packit.yml packit.json  Values    Key name Type Description     debug bool enable debug logs   fas_user string username in Fedora account system (to perform kinit if needed)   authentication dict tokens for services (GitHub, Pagure)   upstream_git_remote string name of the git remote to discover upstream project URL from    The authentication is a dictionary where:\n key is a hostname, url or name that can be mapped to a service-type, for example github.com or pagure value is a dictionary with keys: token and instance_url (optional)  e.g.:\nauthentication: github.com: token: mnbvcxz123456 pagure: token: qwertyuiop098765 instance_url: https://src.fedoraproject.org The GitHub token is needed when packit interacts with Github API, get it at https://github.com/settings/tokens (getting full read \u0026amp; write repo scope should be enough). The Pagure token needed to access REST API, get it at https://src.fedoraproject.org/settings#nav-api-tab\nSpecifying tokens as direct keys github_token and pagure_user_token has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions.\nSince API tokens are a very sensitive information, please do NOT ever store them in a public (such as a GitHub repository). The configuration file here is located on your workstation, please do NOT confuse it with a config file for your project - that one is described above in the first section of this document.\nServer-side configuration These values are used to configure packit service. No need to bother with them, they serve as a documentation for us, packit service developers.\n   Key name Type Description     keytab_path string path to a Kerberos keytab file (requires fas_user to be set)   github_app_id string github app ID used for authentication   github_app_cert_path string path to a certificate associated with a github app   webhook_secret string when specified in a Github App settings, GitHub uses it to create a hash signature with each payload    "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Testing Farm is Packit\u0026rsquo;s testing system. It is a containerized service for running tests. Test execution is configured via Flexible Metadata Format, according to the Metadata Specification.\nGo through the User Guide to get a quick start introduction. See the Examples section to get some more inspiration. The Support Matrix gives overview of what\u0026rsquo;s currently supported. In the Architecture section you will find information about Testing Farm\u0026rsquo;s internals.\nUser Guide The easiest way to get started is to use the tmt tool which will help you with the setup. Install the latest stable version directly from Fedora. See docs for more installation options.\nsudo dnf install -y tmt  Enable Testing In order to enable test execution simply include tests jobs in the .packit.yaml configuration:\njobs: - job: tests trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - fedora-all  You can use fedora-development, fedora-stable or release specific targets such as fedora-31-x86_64 for test targets as well.\nSmoke Test Let\u0026rsquo;s enable a very simple smoke test which will run your application and check the exit code. Change to the root of the project git repository and use the tmt init command to initialize the metadata. For the simple smoke test we\u0026rsquo;ll be using the mini template:\n$ cd ~/git/did $ tmt init --template mini Tree '/home/psss/git/did' initialized. Applying template 'mini'. Directory '/home/psss/git/did/plans' created. Plan '/home/psss/git/did/plans/example.fmf' created.  Let\u0026rsquo;s see what the example plan contains:\n$ cat plans/example.fmf summary: Basic smoke test execute: script: tmt --help  Update the script line with the desired command line which should be executed as a test. It\u0026rsquo;s also possible to provide several commands to be executed in this way:\nsummary: Basic smoke test execute: script: - did --help - did --test  You might want to rename the plan to something more reasonable like smoke.fmf. When commiting new changes, make sure you include the special .fmf directory as well. It marks the root of the metadata tree and is needed for proper metadata detection.\n$ git add plans .fmf  Now just create a new pull request and you\u0026rsquo;re done!\nBeakerLib Test Let\u0026rsquo;s have a bunch of beakerlib tests stored in a git repository with their metadata. See the shared tests/selinux repository for an example of such tests. In order to enable these tests we will use tmt plan create to create the template for us:\n$ tmt init Tree '/home/psss/git/did' initialized. $ tmt plan create /plans/integration --template full Directory '/home/psss/git/did/plans' created. Plan '/home/psss/git/did/plans/integration.fmf' created.  Here\u0026rsquo;s what we get in the integration.fmf file:\nsummary: Essential command line features discover: how: fmf repository: https://github.com/psss/tmt prepare: how: ansible playbooks: plans/packages.yml execute: how: beakerlib  Let\u0026rsquo;s update the summary and repository link to point to the right location. The prepare section can be used to prepare the environment for testing. As we don\u0026rsquo;t have any extra requirements we can safely remove it for now. The resulting integration.fmf will look like this:\nsummary: Run integration tests for all SELinux components discover: how: fmf repository: https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/selinux execute: how: beakerlib  That\u0026rsquo;s it. Now just commit the changes and create a new pull request. Make sure you include the special .fmf directory in the commit as well. It marks the root of the metadata tree and is needed for proper metadata detection.\n$ git add plans .fmf  Now let\u0026rsquo;s wait for the results from Packit directly in the pull request!\nRestart Testing The testing will be automatically started after an update to the pull request and successful copr build. To trigger retesting manually (can come handy in case of infrastructure issues for example), you can use the following comment in the pull request:\n/packit test  Support Matrix Currently only a subset of the metadata specification is implemented: It is possible to run BeakerLib tests and arbitrary shell commands. List of supported steps and implementations:\n Discover: fmf Prepare: ansible Execute: shell, beakerlib  See the Metadata Specification for a detailed description of individual test steps.\nTest Environment We currently support running tests in an x86_64 virtual machine only. The system is using qemu-kvm with hardware acceleration. You have full root access in the machine. The test environment currently cannot be easily changed.\nAdditional machine specs:\n RAM: 2 GB HDD: 4 GB  Debugging and Reproducing We are working on an easy way how to develop new tests, debug and reproduce issues for failed runs. Until that is ready, your best option is to spin up a new Fedora Docker container or run the Fedora Cloud Base qcow2 manually via qemu-kvm or libvirt. See the Worker section for details how to run the tool locally.\nExamples Get inspiration for a quick start from a couple of real-life examples!\nUsing Filters Use a custom filter in the discover step in order to choose relevant tests only:\ndiscover: how: fmf filter: \u0026quot;tier: 1\u0026quot; repository: https://src.fedoraproject.org/tests/selinux  Prepare Step The prepare step can be used to define how test environment should be prepared before testing. Provide one or more paths to ansible playbooks:\nprepare: how: ansible playbooks: - setup/packages.yml  Apache Test Here is an example of a simple integration test for the web server httpd and curl utility:\n/apache/smoke: execute: script: - dnf -y install httpd curl - systemctl start httpd - echo foo \u0026gt; /var/www/html/index.html - curl http://localhost/ | grep foo  Plan /apache/smoke defines only the execute step. Individual shell commands are provided as a list. Testing will fail if any of the commands returns a non-zero exit status.\nSystemd Tests Below you can find little bit more interesting example of a systemd test configuration:\n/systemd/smoke: summary: Basic set of quick smoke tests for systemd. discover: how: fmf filter: \u0026quot;tier: 1 \u0026amp; distro: rhel-8\u0026quot; repository: \u0026quot;https://github.com/systemd-rhel/tests\u0026quot; prepare: how: ansible playbooks: [setup/packages.yml] execute: how: beakerlib  This plan enables a set of Tier 1 tests from the shared systemd tests repository. The meaning of individual attributes is as follows:\n Summary — an optional but useful attribute describing high-level purpose of the plan. Discover — instructs to fetch tests from given repository and select relevant ones by provided filter. Prepare — specifies which ansible playbook should be applied to prepare environment for testing. Execute — defines that the beakerlib framework should be used for running the tests.  FMF Tests Here\u0026rsquo;s a real-life example of tests enabled for the fmf package. There are several plans defined under the plans directory. The smoke plan enables a super basic test checking availability of the fmf command:\nsummary: Just a basic smoke test execute: how: shell script: fmf --help  Plan features is used to execute all available beakerlib tests from the fmf repository:\nsummary: Essential command line features discover: how: fmf repository: https://github.com/psss/fmf execute: how: beakerlib  It is also possible to select only a subset of available tests. This is demonstrated by the docs plan. Use an fmf filter like tier:1 to select tests for execution. You can also reference a specific feature area instead:\nsummary: Ensure that documentation is present discover: how: fmf repository: https://github.com/psss/fmf filter: coverage:/stories/docs.* execute: how: beakerlib  See the stories directory to get some inspiration for organizing stories and requirements.\nIssues \u0026amp; RFEs If you have found an issue or have an RFE, please use Testing Farm\u0026rsquo;s general project to file an issue.\nArchitecture High Level Overview Testing Farm is a containerized application running on Kubernetes. It consists of 4 main components. It\u0026rsquo;s source code is located under the testing-farm organization on gitlab.com.\nCurrently Testing Farm is deployed on Centos CI Openshift, where it runs it\u0026rsquo;s components and uses the same cluster as the testing infrastructure. See section Test Environment for more information about the test environment.\nComponents API API is a REST API endpoint used for integration with other services. Packit Service uses this API to trigger tests. For each trigger request the API runs a Worker on the cluster as a separate pod.\nThe Console component uses it to get the logs of the Workers. Each trigger request MUST contain a unique pipeline ID, generated by the requester, which identifies the request and result and is used to access the console and testing artifacts.\nThe API is currently in version 0 and it is expected to change.\nThe source code of the API is located in the testing-farm/api project.\nConsole Is a React.js application that uses API\u0026rsquo;s console endpoint to access the Worker\u0026rsquo;s pod console. Currently it is the main entrypoint for a user. Packit users can access the console by clicking the Details link in the Github PR test results.\nConsole provides also a link to produced test artifacts.\nThe source code of the Console is located in the testing-farm/console project.\nArtifacts Artifacts component provides access to the artifact storage to the end users. Artifacts are stored on a persistent volume storage which is shared with all the workers. Artifacts are not accessed directly, but via the Console.\nThe source code of the Artifacts is located in the testing-farm/artifacts project.\nWorker Worker is a container image which runs the testing workloads. Each worker is run in a separate pod.\nThe worker can be easily run from your localhost and if it has access to /dev/kvm, it can run basically the same workloads as CI. We will use it in the future to provide a seamless experience to the end users to reproduce the tests on your localhost.\nIf you want to try out worker now, you can easily run some tests from a repository with FMF tests with the command bellow.\npodman run --device /dev/kvm quay.io/testing-farm/cruncher cruncher --git-url https://github.com/packit/hello-world --keep-instance  The option --keep-instance will keep the VM reserved and you will be presented in the worker logs how to connect to the machine via ssh.\nThe source code of the Worker is located in the testing-farm/cruncher project.\n"

You are able to set up builds when you push to a branch, we have set this up for master branch of packit, feel free to get inspired (by @lachmanfrantisek, #851).  packit-as-a-service  We have run into multiple problems when you set up jobs for PRs and branch pushes - there were multiple fixes for this, packit-service wasn\u0026rsquo;t able to work well with the fact that there are multiple jobs defined for the same job type - e.g. build.  Week 24 (June 8th - June 11th) packit  Tomas re-implemented overriding of package config per job. This will enable overriding configuration for builds and releases once the corresponding changes are merged in Packit-as-a-Service. (#858, #859).  packit-as-a-service  We are now parsing events from Koji about the progress of the builds and report them (by Franta, #657). We are now able to listen to Gitlab hooks and parse the (comment \u0026amp; push) events (by Shreyas, #629, #671).

We now have an API endpoint for obtaining results from testing farm (by @IceWreck, #678). We finished the implementation of the trigger to create bugs in Bugzilla. Therefore packit is now able to create bugzilla for accepted PR\u0026rsquo;s in CentOS (by @jpopelka, #662).

We improved the behaviour when loading the authentication in the config file - users are warned only if deprecated keys are used, no more confusing messages when you do not have authentication key in the configuration (#754).  packit-service  We periodically check the status of the copr-build so that we do not need to rely on the Fedora message bus. This should avoid failures in build status reporting (#490). Propose-update triggered by comment in Github now recognizes also pre-releases (#498). Several bugs in how we report results from Testing farm have been fixed and Testing farm results should now appear correctly in commit status checks (#496), (#505), (#510), (#513).  Week 13 (March 23th - March 27th)  New Packit version 0.9.0 was released.

(#579) Target aliases (currently fedora-development, fedora-stable, fedora-all) can now be used in the packit config file. (#619) When doing a new update in Fedora dist-git, packit now by default creates a new pull request instead of pushing directly to dist-git. (#622)  packit service  Does not set test checks when tests are not configured. (#275) Supports target aliases and dist-git branches aliases. (#277, #285) Nicely formats errors from OpenShift API. (#283) Runs Copr build when user adds a /packit build comment into a PR. (#290)  Week 50 packit  If there is no upstream_package_name/downstream_package_name given in .packit.yaml, they now default to the name of the GitHub repo. (#624) If no jobs are defined in .packit.yaml packit by default runs build job on fedora-stable targets and propose_downstream on fedora-all branches. (#625) build command has nicer output. (#630) Smaller fixes. (#630, #636)  packit service  Creates a new issue when propose-update fails. (#300) Better reports failed submitting of a Copr build. (#301)  "

	"content": "With this blog post we\u0026rsquo;d like to continue with the idea of openly communicating changes in Packit. Since most of the developers use Packit as the GitHub App (which uses code from this repository - Packit Service), this blog will be about changes in all the parts, i.e. the GitHub App, the Packit Service and Packit itself.\nContinuous Deployment (CD) At the moment the workflow is that one of us manually triggers production container image build at the end of a week. This image is then automatically deployed into our production instance of the service over a weekend (Sun/Mon night) so that everyone can start a week with all the amazing stuff we added the previous week. In case an issue makes it through our staging instance into production uncaught, we can easily rollback on Monday. The same person also writes down what\u0026rsquo;s changed in Packit (service/app) since previous deployment.\nChanges in production (since the end of November) Previous post is almost half a year old so we won\u0026rsquo;t list all the changes since then, but only since last deployment, i.e. since end of December.\nPackit Previous deployment was running packit-0.7.1. We haven\u0026rsquo;t released a newer version since then, but in the service we install Packit from the Git repository (we have a separate stable git branch for our production deployment). From the most visible changes, Packit now:\n better handles Create-archive action is able to work in a repo with detached head logs output from subprocesses in realtime syncs config file and spec file by default in Propose-update action hadles patches with undecodable chars  Packit Service Now:\n better reports Copr builds  uses separate commit status for srpm build and every chroot clears test farm commit statuses when new build is triggered better handles failed Copr builds   gracefully handles no config file in the repo better handles when no (copr build) targets are specified in config file better checks whitelist of users does not create duplicate tickets in our notification repo when a new user install the app  Changes not visible to end users:\n using Requre for integration/E2E tests Fedora messaging consumer part of the service has been improved and moved to separate repo/image using FAS instead of Fedora Badges for checking whether a user is Fedora packager many improved logs many bugs squashed lot\u0026rsquo;s of code refactored  "

	"content": "Can I use the packit service as soon as I install it into my repository? Thanks for your interest in Packit Service! In order to start using the service you need to be whitelisted, which is an action to be done by us. Once we put you on the whitelist, we\u0026rsquo;ll get in touch with you. We are now on-boarding Fedora contributors (with a Fedora Account System account).\nCan I use packit service for any GitHub repository? Since packit service builds your PRs in Fedora COPR build service, by using Packit-as-a-service, your software needs to comply with COPR rules. If any of these points are violated, we\u0026rsquo;ll remove the builds and may put you on a blacklist so you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to use the service again.\nHow can I contact you? If you encounter a problem while using Packit-as-a-service, please open an upstream issue. In case of any other questions, feel free to contact us:\n freenode #packit user-cont-team@redhat.com  Why do I have to maintain .packit.yaml and a spec file upstream? We are working on simplifying the .packit.yaml so it\u0026rsquo;s as small as possible. We will also handle all potentially backward incompatible changes of .packit.yaml. Spec file can be downloaded (see specific question below) from Fedora Pagure instead of having it included in the upstream repository.\nBut what are the benefits? Packit makes it trivial to run your project as part of an OS. It provides feedback to your project at the time when the changes are being developed so you can fix incompatible code when you are working on it, not when it\u0026rsquo;s already released. When you push commits to a pull request, you\u0026rsquo;ll get RPM build and test results right away.\nWhy Fedora? We\u0026rsquo;ve started with Fedora Linux because we work for Red Hat and we ❤ Fedora.\nHow is Packit different from other services? Packit connects the existing services (Copr, Pagure, Koji, Bodhi) together.\nCan we use Packit with Gitlab? Packit service is closely tied to GitHub right now because most of the projects are hosted on GitHub. Let us know if you\u0026rsquo;d like to see Gitlab support.\nHow can I download RPM spec file if it is not part of upstream repository? If you do not want to have the RPM spec file in your upstream repository, you can download it in actions section.\nAdd actions section to your packit.yaml configuration file and download the spec file in a hook post_upstream_clone. Packit service has a limited set of commands available so please use wget or curl.\nThe configuration file with downloading the RPM spec file now looks like this:\nspecfile_path: packit.spec synced_files: - packit.spec - .packit.yaml upstream_package_name: packitos downstream_package_name: packit actions: post-upstream-clone: \u0026quot;wget https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/packit/raw/master/f/packit.spec\u0026quot; I have a template of a spec file in my repo: can packit work with it? Yes!\nThe solution is, again, actions and hooks. Just render the spec after the upstream repo is cloned:\nspecfile_path: my-project.spec upstream_package_name: my-project-src downstream_package_name: my-project actions: post-upstream-clone: \u0026quot;make generate-spec\u0026quot; Where the \u0026ldquo;generate-spec\u0026rdquo; make target could look like this:\ngenerate-spec: sed -e 's/@@VERSION@@/$(VERSION)/g' my-project.spec.template \u0026gt;my-project.spec As a practical example, cockpit-podman project is using this functionality.\nCan I use CentOS Stream with packit service? Yes, you can! It\u0026rsquo;s very simple, just add centos-stream-x86_64 as a target for the copr_build job:\njobs: - job: copr_build trigger: pull_request metadata: targets: - centos-stream-x86_64 After adding tests I see error \u0026lsquo;No FMF metadata found.\u0026rsquo; If you encounter this error when running tests via Testing Farm, it means you forgot to initialize the metadata tree with fmf init and include the .fmf directory in the pull request. See Testing Farm documentation for more information.\nDoes packit work with rpmautospec? Good that you ask. It does, packit works with rpmautospec quite nicely.\nBefore you start, please make sure that you follow latest documentation for rpmautospec.\nrpmautospec utilizes two RPM macros:\n autorel — to populate Release autochangelog — to figure out changelog  If you want your upstream spec file to also work well when rpmautospec-rpm-macros is not installed, set Release to this:\nRelease: %{?autorel}%{!?autorel:1} This construct uses autorel macro if it\u0026rsquo;s defined, and if it\u0026rsquo;s not, it sets release to 1.\nFor %changelog, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to include the changelog file upstream and you can have it downstream only, which makes sense - changelog is specific to a release.\nHow do I install dependencies for my commands in packit-service? We are running all commands, defined by you, in a sandbox which is locked-down. At the moment we don\u0026rsquo;t have any mechanism for you to define the dependencies you need and us making them available for you.\nIn the mean time we are solving these requests one by one, so please reach out to us.\nA command failed in packit-service: how do I reproduce it locally? We don\u0026rsquo;t have an end-to-end solution to this, yet.\nIn the meantime, you can pull our production sandbox image and run the command inside. As an example, this is how we were debugging build problems with anaconda:\n  Clone the upstream git repo.\n  Pull the sandbox image:\n  $ docker pull docker.io/usercont/sandcastle:prod Launch the container and bind-mount the upstream project inside:  $ docker run -ti --rm -v $PWD:/anaconda docker.io/usercont/sandcastle:prod bash Run commands of your choice:  [root@4af5dbd9c828 /]# cd /anaconda [root@4af5dbd9c828 anaconda]# ./configure checking for a BSD-compatible install... /usr/bin/install -c checking whether build environment is sane... yes checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /usr/bin/mkdir -p checking for gawk... gawk checking whether make sets $(MAKE)... yes checking whether make supports nested variables... yes checking whether UID '0' is supported by ustar format... yes checking whether GID '0' is supported by ustar format... yes checking how to create a ustar tar archive... gnutar checking whether make supports nested variables... (cached) yes checking whether make supports the include directive... yes (GNU style) checking for gcc... gcc checking whether the C compiler works... yes ... Our deployment is running in OpenShift Online which is using docker as a container engine, that\u0026rsquo;s why we are using docker here and not podman.\n"

	"content": "Packit Packit provides tooling and automation to integrate upstream open source projects into Fedora operating system. Packit project is composed of two main components:\n  packit, a CLI tool, which you can install locally and start using right away.\n  Packit-as-a-Service, a GitHub app — it can provide you feedback on how is your project integrated with Fedora Operating System.\n  Feel free to jump into the guide for using packit.\nUpstream repository https://github.com/packit/packit\nContact You can find us at Freenode IRC channel #packit, or feel free to create an issue in any of our GitHub projects.\nWe are also available on this e-mail: user-cont-team@redhat.com.\nThe key principles of packit   Packit aims to make things easy and right. But if the default behavior is not the right for you, there is still a way around, but may not be that simple. For example you can use actions to replace default packit\u0026rsquo;s behavior with a script of yours.\n  Reuse existing tools and services where it makes sense: don\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel.\n  You can consume packit in two forms:\n Packit tool can run on your laptop and you run commands you want. Packit service reacts to events and performs actions which you defined in your packit.yaml.    We don\u0026rsquo;t break backwards compatibility just like that.\n  Packit has a deprecation policy:\n We can mark a behaviour as deprecated. Deprecated content can be removed or changed after at least 3 minor releases. Deprecated content is advertised in our changelog, printed in terminal or tracked in your issue tracker.    We care about artifacts which Fedora supports: at the moment it\u0026rsquo;s RPMs, modules and container images.\n Our initial focus is solely on RPMs.    Packit respects Fedora guidelines.\n  We want latest content in Fedora Rawhide, but only if it works (the new content can be built and tests are passing).\n  Any task done by the automation system must be able to be performed by a human when that is required. Packit service must be capable of recovering from such situation.\n  Packit developers must be able to iterate on all parts packit (testing a change, merging a change, deploying to production) at a pace of at least every two weeks. To accomplish this, the release and validation processes are completely automated.\n  All the tests are passing in CI systems for master branches for all our projects. No excuses.\n  Contributions to packit must be possible by any developer, maintainer, tester, or other engineer. Any Fedora developer or tester should be able to reproduce a bot locally on their machine, given appropriate credentials.\n  Why packit?   Our intent is to bring downstream and upstream communities closer: provide feedback from downstream to upstream. (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Hello \u0026lt;upstream project Y\u0026gt;, your newest release doesn\u0026rsquo;t work in Fedora Rawhide, it breaks \u0026lt;Z\u0026gt;, here is a link to logs.\u0026quot;)\n  We want to only merge, build and compose components which integrate well with the rest of the operating system. The biggest impact of such behavior will be on Fedora Rawhide and when working on a new Fedora release.\n  Automatically pull and validate new upstream releases. This can be a trivial thing to do, why should maintainers waste their times on work which can be automated.\n  Developing in dist-git is cumbersome. Editing patch files and moving tarballs around is not fun. Why not working with the source code itself? With source-git, you\u0026rsquo;ll have upstream git history and the dist-git content combined in a single repository.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s use modern development techniques such as pull requests, code review, modern git forges, automation and continuous integration. We have computers to do all the mundane tasks. Why we, as humans, should do such work?\n  We want dist-git to be \u0026ldquo;a database of content in a release\u0026rdquo; rather a place to do actual work. On the other hand, you\u0026rsquo;ll still be able to interact with dist-git the same way. We are not taking that away. Source-git is meant to be the modern, better alternative.\n  DevConf.cz \u0026ldquo;Auto-maintain your package\u0026rdquo; talk.\n"
