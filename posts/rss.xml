            <description><![CDATA["How absurdly simple!" I cried.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"How absurdly simple!" I cried.</p><p>"Quite so!" said he, a little nettled. "Every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you."</p><ul><li>Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Adventure of the Dancing Men"</li></ul><p>We have planned for a while to use Packit to generate packages on Copr
on demand for our somewhat complicated Rust executable, stratisd. It
looked like this was going to be challenging, and in a sense it was,
but once the task was completed, it turned out to have been pretty
straightforward.</p><p>The two primary parts of our Stratis project are stratisd, a big,
fairly complicated Rust project which generates multiple distinct Rust
executables and also installs scripts and configuration files and so
forth, and stratis-cli, a relatively simple Python project which
communicates with stratisd over the D-Bus. Our main purpose in getting
on-demand packages of both these projects was not to test the
packaging, although that is a nice thing to do, but to have a
convenient way to do functional testing of the project, frequently
generating a stratisd package from one stratisd pull request and a
stratis-cli package from a matching stratis-cli pull request.</p><p>The Packit team had already obliged us by preparing a Packit
configuration file for our stratis-cli repo, we thus merely had to
figure out how to do the same for stratisd. We already had some
scripts which we could run by hand to make the SRPMs for both projects
so that we could manually send them to Copr so, as it turned out, all
we really needed to do was figure out how to write a Packit
configuration file for stratisd so that Packit would do these tasks
for us. There follows a quick summary of the decisions we made to
solve this problem. Note that our whole and only task was to figure
out how to create the source artifacts and edit the spec file and
to provide these in such a way that Packit could take over from there,
build the SRPM, and carry on to request the Copr builds which provide
the binary packages for testing.</p><p>A Packit configuration is used to set certain configuration <em>options</em>,
to override certain <em>actions</em>, or to define certain <em>hooks</em>. The
available actions and hooks are specific to a given job or set of jobs.
If an action is not
overridden in a project's Packit configuration, Packit will execute
its own default action. For example, Packit's default for the
create-archive action is just git-archive. Any action can be overridden by
specifying a sequence of commands. For the stratisd Packit
configuration, we found that we had to override the majority of the
actions.</p><p>Note that the <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratisd/blob/master/.packit.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stratisd Packit configuration file</a> is quite
simple as most of the action is in the <code>create_archive.py</code> script. Some
things to make note of are the following:</p><ol><li><p><code>merge_pr_in_ci</code> is set to false. This prevents Packit from
automatically merging our pull request into its target branch. It has
always been our custom to build from the unmerged branch when testing
PRs and we preferred to do the same in our Packit configuration.</p></li><li><p><code>fix-spec-file</code> contains a dummy echo action. This is how we override
Packit's default spec file editing action. Instead of specifying an
override for this action, we use <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/ci/blob/master/release_management/create_artifacts.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our own script</a>, <code>create_artifacts.py</code>, to
edit the spec file as well as to generate the three source artifacts that we
use in this package in the <code>create-archive</code> action.</p></li><li><p><code>create_artifacts.py</code> uses the Packit team's <a href="https://github.com/packit/specfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specfile package</a> to
edit the stratisd specfile. We needed just two modifications: 1. To overwrite the Version field with our preferred version string. 2. To overwrite the Source entries with the names and paths of the
source artifacts.
This requires just one <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/ci/blob/master/release_management/_utils.py#L80" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very simple function</a> using specfile.</p></li><li><p>In the Packit configuration, the <code>update_release</code> field is set to
false. We prefer to update the Version field in the spec file using
our <code>create_archive.py</code> script, so that the updated version is
recognized as a pre-release version of our current version by
<code>rpmdev-vercmp</code>.</p></li><li><p>We modified our <a href="https://github.com/stratis-storage/stratis-cli/blob/master/.packit.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stratis-cli Packit configuration file</a> to work the
same way as our stratisd one.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, we got the ability to take advantage of the Packit
infrastructure for Copr builds by figuring out how to satisfy its
requirements for the source artifacts and the specfile. Note that our
decisions about how to do this were made based on the scripts we had
already written to generate the SRPMs and the particular requirements
of our project. For example, our release scripts are written in
Python, and we stuck with that choice. That turned out to be handy,
because that allowed us to use the specfile project in our scripts to
edit the spec file. But it would have been possible to write the
artifact creation script in Rust using the cargo xtask pattern just as
well, and to solve the spec file rewriting problem using, e.g., sed.
We overwrote the Version field in the spec file, rather than allowing
Packit to autobump our release number, because our development process
requires us to bump the version in the Cargo.toml (for Rust) and
setup.cfg (for Python) files to the version we will release as soon as
we begin development. These choices and their implementations could be
made differently to support a project with different constraints and
different existing infrastructure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the upcoming months, we plan to migrate our service to a new cluster. However, this may affect <code>propose_downstream</code>
and <code>pull_from_upstream</code> jobs due to the new firewall rules. The problematic aspects could be:</p><ul><li>commands you run in your <code>actions</code> during syncing the release involving interactions with external servers</li><li>downloading your sources from various hosting services (crates.io, npm, gems, etc.)</li></ul><p>To smoothen this transition, we kindly encourage you to enable one of these jobs on our already migrated staging instance.
This recommendation is particularly important if you belong to one of the groups affected by the two previous points.
This proactive step will help us identify and address any issues promptly.</p><p>Both instances can be run at the same time and the behaviour can be configured via the <code>packit_instances</code> configuration key,
which is by default set to <code>["prod"]</code>. Picking just one instance is required only for <code>koji_build</code> and <code>bodhi_update</code> jobs since
both instances work with the production instances of Fedora systems. To avoid too much noise in your dist-git PRs, you
may enable the <code>pull_from_upstream</code>/<code>propose_downstream</code> job for only one target, resulting in only one additional PR created.</p><p>Here's how you can enable one of the jobs on the staging instance:</p><ul><li><code>pull-from-upstream</code>:
The only thing needed is to duplicate the job in your Packit config using <code>packit_instances</code> configuration option. Example:</li></ul><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">job</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> pull_from_upstream</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">trigger</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> release</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">packit_instances</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"stg"</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">dist_git_branches</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain"> fedora</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain">rawhide</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><ul><li><code>propose-downstream</code>:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, we received multiple contributions from the Strimzi team, specifically <a href="https://github.com/Frawless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jakub Stejskal</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/kornys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Kornel</a>,
for the functionality of manual triggering of jobs and other related improvements, mostly focusing on the testing
UX. We are very happy about these and would like to showcase the results of their awesome contributions.</p><p>Strimzi team wanted to onboard Packit to ease their testing in pull requests, but they have had multiple test suites that could run
for a long time, and they did not want to run all of the test suites for each new commit in a pull request.</p><p>Let's now look together at what they implemented to solve their usecase.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="manual-only-triggering-of-jobs">Manual-only triggering of jobs<a href="#manual-only-triggering-of-jobs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Manual-only triggering of jobs" title="Direct link to Manual-only triggering of jobs">​</a></h2><p>Firstly, a new configuration option <a href="/docs/configuration/jobs#manual_trigger"><code>manual_trigger</code></a> was introduced.
With this new configuration option, users can enable triggering Packit jobs only manually and avoid specified jobs being
automatically triggered when, e.g., a new commit arrives to a pull request.
The only thing needed to make this work is to add <code>manual_trigger: true</code> to the job's definition:</p><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-yaml codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">job</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> tests</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">trigger</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> pull_request</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">targets</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain"> centos</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain">stream</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain">9</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">-</span><span class="token plain">x86_64</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">skip_build</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token boolean important" style="color:#36acaa">true</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token key atrule" style="color:#00a4db">manual_trigger</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token boolean important" style="color:#36acaa">true</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>This new configuration option allows saving resources and running builds or tests, e.g. only when the pull request is ready for

A particular example could be running a smoke test job before running the sanity one.</p><p>To solve this, for the test jobs, Jakub and David introduced 2 new ways to trigger a specific job.</p><p>The first one is to trigger the job based on the configured <a href="/docs/configuration/upstream/tests#optional-parameters"><code>identifier</code></a>. To trigger a test job with <code>identifier: regression-operators</code> in the
job configuration, the Packit comment command will be:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/packit test --identifier regression-operators</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>That command will execute the job with this specific identifier, nothing else.</p><p>And what if someone wants to execute more than one job?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are very happy to announce a major enhancement to Packit! We have now added support for
monorepositories, enabling the integration of upstream repositories containing multiple downstream packages.
If you have a repository in the monorepo format, Packit can now help you automate the integration to downstream
distributions both from CLI and as a service.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configuration">Configuration<a href="#configuration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configuration" title="Direct link to Configuration">​</a></h2><p>Let's take a look at how a monorepository should be configured so that Packit can automate the process!</p><p>The main addition to the Packit configuration file in the context of monorepositories are the keys
<a href="/docs/configuration#packages"><code>packages</code></a> and <a href="/docs/configuration#paths"><code>paths</code></a>.</p><p><code>packages</code> holds a dictionary of <code>{package_name: package_configuration}</code> where package configuration can contain any keys
that were previously used as top-level keys for the standard (single) package configuration. The <code>paths</code> can be defined
in each <code>package_configuration</code> and should hold a list of paths that should be considered for the particular package.</p><p>The <code>packages</code> section in the configuration can then look like this:</p><div class="language-yaml codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have recently made some fixes to the process of handling the <code>Release</code> field regarding the <code>%autorelease</code> macro, so let's take that opportunity to explain how it works.</p><p>You can maintain the <code>Release</code> field manually, you can use a dummy value or you can take advantage of the <code>%autorelease</code> macro.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="maintaining-release-manually">Maintaining <code>Release</code> manually<a href="#maintaining-release-manually" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to maintaining-release-manually" title="Direct link to maintaining-release-manually">​</a></h3><p>You can maintain the <code>Release</code> field manually as you would do downstream, for example you could bump the value every time you make changes to the spec file and reset it to <em>1</em> when you release a new version.</p><p>Packit will not touch the value unless it detects a change in <code>Version</code> and no change in <code>Release</code>. In such case it will reset <code>Release</code> to <em>1</em> in the dist-git spec file, to ensure that the resulting NVR is not higher than any existing NVR in dist-git (that could have been already created by <code>propose_downstream</code> in a different branch for example).</p><p>You most likely want to enable the <code>sync_changelog</code> option so that your upstream <code>%changelog</code> is synchronized to dist-git as well.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-a-dummy-value">Using a dummy value<a href="#using-a-dummy-value" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Using a dummy value" title="Direct link to Using a dummy value">​</a></h3><p>You can use a value like <em>0</em> or <em>1</em> and never touch it, Packit will make sure it is set to <em>1</em> in the dist-git spec file.
You can do this if you don't care about upstream <code>%changelog</code>, i.e. you have <code>sync_changelog</code> disabled and use <code>copy_upstream_release_description</code> or the <code>changelog-entry</code> action to generate it downstream.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-autorelease">Using <code>%autorelease</code><a href="#using-autorelease" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to using-autorelease" title="Direct link to using-autorelease">​</a></h3><p>You can use the <code>%autorelease</code> macro in the <code>Release</code> field and the <code>%autochangelog</code> macro in <code>%changelog</code>. In this case Packit will not change anything, it will only synchronize changes made to the arguments of the macro (if any).</p><p>If you want to start using <code>%autorelease</code> and <code>%autochangelog</code>, you should <a href="https://docs.pagure.org/fedora-infra.rpmautospec/opting-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">do the change</a> in dist-git before releasing a new version upstream and triggering <code>propose_downstream</code> job, otherwise Packit will continue to set <code>Release</code> to <em>1</em> in the dist-git spec file.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="autorelease-in-dist-git"><code>%autorelease</code> in dist-git<a href="#autorelease-in-dist-git" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to autorelease-in-dist-git" title="Direct link to autorelease-in-dist-git">​</a></h2><p>No matter how you maintain the <code>Release</code> field in your upstream spec file, Packit will never overwrite the <code>%autorelease</code> macro if it is used in the dist-git spec file.</p>]]></content:encoded>

it installs everything it needs.
Like in case of Python, pre-commit <code>pip</code> installs all the dependencies.</p><p>The problem in our case is that <code>packit</code> has a lot of dependencies and
some of them (if missing) are compiled from source when you try to
<a href="https://packit.dev/docs/cli/#from-pypi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pip install packit</a>.
That needs <code>gcc</code> and additional <code>devel</code> packages
to be installed on the machine prior to running the hook for the first time.
That would make the hook usage very user unfriendly, leaving aside that
sometimes (in a CI) you don't have access to the machine to install them
prior to running the hooks.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you will see in the following paragraphs, the year 2022 was really fruitful for the Packit project. Without further ado, let’s take a look at what the Packit team accomplished last year!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fedora-automation">Fedora automation<a href="#fedora-automation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fedora automation" title="Direct link to Fedora automation">​</a></h2><p>We have made a huge improvement in downstream automation. At the beginning of the year, we <a href="https://packit.dev/posts/downstream-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finished the workflow</a> and you are now able to use Packit to get your release from upstream via dist-git and Koji to Bodhi. As usual, you can pick just what you need. This workflow consists of three jobs:</p><ul><li><code>propose-downstream</code>: as a reaction to an upstream release, the source archive is saved to a lookaside cache, specfile is updated and sent as a pull request to Fedora dist-git.</li><li><code>koji-build</code>: as a reaction to a new dist-git commit, a new Koji build is triggered (you can specify allowed authors of a commit or merged pull request).</li><li><code>bodhi-update</code>: as a reaction to a successfully finished Koji build, a new Bodhi update is created</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Detail of a Bodhi update created by Packit" src="/assets/images/bodhi-update-b24d047f5572831c4ad8de446cf81148.png" width="851" height="477" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But that wasn’t all. At the very end of the year, the Packit team implemented an alternative to the <code>propose-downstream</code> job that we call <code>pull-from-upstream</code>. The logic of the job is the very same: the source archive is saved to a lookaside cache, specfile is updated and sent as a pull request to Fedora dist-git. The only – and main – difference is that the job is defined downstream (in the default dist-git branch, <code>rawhide</code> or its <code>main</code> alias) so you don’t need to install Packit in the upstream repository. The information about a new release is received from the <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Upstream_Release_Monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upstream Release Monitoring</a>. The <code>pull-from-upstream</code> job is mainly targeted to the Fedora maintainers without upstream access or with upstream not being supported by Packit. (This job works with any upstream using git.) The setup is nicely described in <a href="https://packit.dev/posts/pull-from-upstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this blog post</a>. And if you want a dedicated documentation page for the Fedora downstream automation, look at <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/fedora-releases-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://packit.dev/docs/fedora-releases-guide/</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Pull request created by a pull-from-upstream workflow" src="/assets/images/pull-from-upstream-75eca73c81b62ad029f0c029f0b4e557.png" width="1089" height="886" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And that’s still not all, we’ve also added <code>propose-downstream</code> to <a href="https://dashboard.packit.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our dashboard</a>. You can now the jobs in <a href="https://dashboard.packit.dev/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Pipelines view</a>. Also, logs can be checked on a detail page (that can be accessed from a status of a release commit).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Propose downstream result page" src="/assets/images/propose-downstream-result-page-a2d517abb0153c630f4f03b2ad8ccda5.png" width="887" height="617" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Still not convinced we’ve done a lot? When using various downstream jobs, you can still hit an issue now and then. (Messages from Fedora infrastructure can get lost or some intermittent error can occur.) Packit automatically retries to overcome temporary issues, but sometimes it’s not enough or there is a real problem that needs to be fixed elsewhere. We can’t resolve the real problems for you, but we can help let you retry the job when needed. And you have two places where to do that.</p><p>As you might be used to with the <code>propose-downstream</code> job, you can use comments in an upstream issue to retrigger Bodhi updates and Koji builds as well. Just configure <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#issue_repository" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>issue_repository</code></a> so Packit knows where to create issues in case of problems. (This does not need to be an upstream issue and this repository can be used for multiple projects.) Alternatively, if you use dist-git pull requests (either made by Packit or other maintainers), you can use a pull request comment to retrigger Koji Build or Bodhi update.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Comment to recreate a Bodhi update" src="/assets/images/dist-git-pull-request-comment-61dc300ce80bfec8c7ec5dd2baf20c92.png" width="735" height="510" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you are interested in what Packit has done for its users, you can take a look at the activity of the <code>packit</code> (or <code>packit-stg</code>) FAS user in <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/user/packit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dist-git</a>, <a href="https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/userinfo?userID=4641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koji</a> or <a href="https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/users/packit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bodhi</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dist-git activity of Packit user" src="/assets/images/packit-dist-git-activity-b6d823fb44b606593470d5657524a98d.png" width="1105" height="389" class="img_ev3q">

The definitive switch to Copr has been done at the beginning of 2023. For more details, take a look at the <a href="https://packit.dev/posts/copr-srpms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relevant blog post</a>, but let’s shortly describe the benefits:
Most importantly, you can now use <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#srpm_build_deps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>srpm_build_deps</code></a> config option to specify the dependencies needed for the build. With the <a href="https://github.com/packit/sandcastle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">old solution</a>, this process was manual, global and had to be done by Packit maintainers. Another advantage of being able to use Copr for SRPM builds is access to the SRPM artifacts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="self-mapping-of-fas-account">Self-mapping of FAS account<a href="#self-mapping-of-fas-account" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Self-mapping of FAS account" title="Direct link to Self-mapping of FAS account">​</a></h2><p>From the beginning of the Packit project, for every Packit GitHub installation, we have required a Fedora account so we can be sure, that we are safe to use Fedora systems (like Copr or dist-git) on behalf of that user. Since we automate various tasks for you, we’ve made it possible for you to perform this yourself. (Thanks to the user config field in the Fedora Account System.)
If you are interested in how this works, take a look at the blog post we’ve prepared for you: <a href="https://packit.dev/posts/fas-verification-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://packit.dev/posts/fas-verification-automation/</a></p><p>If you wonder why we check permissions for the installation, we have good news for you. This year, we plan to improve the permission schema, do the checks for each job, and require only what is needed. But more about the plans for 2023 later.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Self-mapping process in an issue" src="/assets/images/verify-fas-355a7111420aea52229c20f33a86322c.png" width="932" height="397" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multiple-project-test-runs">Multiple-project test runs<a href="#multiple-project-test-runs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multiple-project test runs" title="Direct link to Multiple-project test runs">​</a></h2><p>If you have multiple connected projects (as we do) and work on a feature spanning more of them, the following feature might come in handy. You can use a commit command with a reference to the other pull request and Packit will use Copr builds from both pull requests during the tests. Want to know more? Check this blog post: <a href="https://packit.dev/posts/testing-farm-triggering/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://packit.dev/posts/testing-farm-triggering/</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Test with external build" src="/assets/images/test-for-external-build-90b12f4f5294499b998234a477d6dbd8.png" width="923" height="884" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="specfile-library">Specfile library<a href="#specfile-library" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Specfile library" title="Direct link to Specfile library">​</a></h2><p>This one might not be relevant to most of our users, but we would still like to announce, that we’ve created <a href="https://github.com/packit/specfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Python library</a> for specfile manipulation. It can not only parse various weird spec files but also can edit them with as little diff as possible. Also, the code is really interesting so check it out. Now, it’s used by Packit and <a href="https://github.com/rebase-helper/rebase-helper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebase-helper</a> and you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzMfBPdFXZY&amp;t=17s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this demo</a> if you want to know more.
In case you’ve missed that, this is not the first time we’ve extracted a part of our codebase for wider usage – another nice example is a <a href="https://github.com/packit/ogr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forge-independent Python library for GitHub/GitLab/Pagure API called OGR</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vm-image-builds">VM Image Builds<a href="#vm-image-builds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to VM Image Builds" title="Direct link to VM Image Builds">​</a></h2><p>Having Copr builds available for your pull-requests is really nice, but you can now have VM image builds as well. It would be really wasteful to do this for each and every commit so we decided to trigger this by a <code>/packit vm-image-build </code> comment. Similarly to other jobs, Packit uses an external system to do the hard work. This feature is possible thanks to the <a href="https://console.redhat.com/insights/image-builder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Hat Image Builder</a>. This feature is a fresh start on this journey and we are investigating the possibilities of Packit in this field. Check <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/upstream/vm_image_build" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our documentation</a> and let us know what you think.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="VM image build as a result of the comment" src="/assets/images/vm-image-build-9778abe48e8d422ff8863368f4df2930.png" width="1103" height="820" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="plans-for-the-next-year">Plans for the next year<a href="#plans-for-the-next-year" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plans for the next year" title="Direct link to Plans for the next year">​</a></h2><p>Do you wonder what we plan for you for the year 2023? That is not a secret. For some time, we have been opening our planning and since the last year, you can check our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/packit/projects/7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanban board</a> since it has become the primary place we use on daily bases. (It used to be half-manually and half-automatically synced.)
Every quarter, our team sits down and discusses our plans for the next three months. We use MOSCOW (=MUST x SHOULD x COULD x WON’T) prioritisation method to group and compare all of our epics. The result of this time’s planning can be seen <a href="https://github.com/orgs/packit/projects/7/views/25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Do you want to know how we decide and how you can influence us? It’s pretty easy. Firstly, we need to know about a bug or feature request. Secondly, the task needs to be worth the work. (And should be related to our mission.) We can’t work on everything so we need to pick the work with a bigger impact (a lot of projects will benefit from that or a significant benefit for a smaller group). So shortly, if you want something to be done: create an issue, provide a clear reasoning why we should do that and find other projects that can benefit from that.</p><p>And also, our project is open source. We are more than happy to help anyone contribute to our code base!</p><hr><p>With that, I, personally, would like to thank all of the Packit team members for their outstanding work during the year. And I also would like to thank you, our users, for using our project, being kind, helpful and patient! I wish you all a happy new year and less mundane work as possible!</p><p>On behalf of the Packit team,

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the previous year, we <a href="/posts/downstream-automation">automated</a> the Fedora downstream release process in Packit.
The first step of the release process, propagating the upstream release to Fedora,
is covered by the <a href="/docs/configuration/upstream/propose_downstream"><code>propose_downstream</code></a> job.
This job updates the sources in Fedora, the spec file, and other needed files and creates pull requests with the changes
in the dist-git repository.</p><p>The downside of this job is that for its execution, users need to install Packit Service GitHub/GitLab
app since this job reacts only to GitHub/GitLab release webhooks.
However, the person who maintains the package in Fedora may not be the upstream maintainer and may not have admin access
to the upstream GitHub/GitLab repository.</p><p>To cover this case, we came up with a new job called <code>pull_from_upstream</code>, which aims to update Fedora dist-git similarly
to <code>propose_downstream</code>, but is configured directly in the dist-git repository.
Let's now look at how to set it up and how it works.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="setup">Setup<a href="#setup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Setup" title="Direct link to Setup">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="upstream-release-monitoring">Upstream release monitoring<a href="#upstream-release-monitoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upstream release monitoring" title="Direct link to Upstream release monitoring">​</a></h3><p><code>pull_from_upstream</code> job reacts to a new bug in <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bugzilla</a> about a new upstream version
of a project. The bug is automatically created by
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/package-maintainers/Upstream_Release_Monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upstream Release Monitoring</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you contribute to projects which depend on each other?
Would you like to test changes spanning multiple repositories together before merging them to the main branch?
Then look no further, Packit's new feature of the Testing Farm integration is what you are looking for!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-it-works">How it works<a href="#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How it works" title="Direct link to How it works">​</a></h3><p>To enable such testing, there is no additional configuration required in your <code>packit.yaml</code>, the typical <a href="/docs/testing-farm">Testing Farm configuration</a> is sufficient.
Once you open a pull request with some changes, tests are going to run as usual with all dependencies being installed based on the test definition, e.g. from Fedora repositories.
To trigger tests with builds from a pull request in another repository, add a comment to the pull request of the form:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/packit test &lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;#&lt;pr-id&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Based on this comment, Testing Farm will first install the recent successful builds created by Packit in the given pull request and then run the tests.
In order for this to work, there must be successful builds for the targets that you are running tests for.
For example, if you are testing against Fedora 36, the pull request that you want to install builds from must contain a successful Fedora 36 build by Packit.</p><p>Let's look at a simple example to demonstrate this feature better.
The Packit CLI uses a library called <code>specfile</code> to modify RPM spec files.
Recently, <code>specfile</code> has added a new feature which makes accessing the <code>Epoch</code> field in the spec file more convenient and we would like to make use of this feature.
However, the changes have not made it to a Fedora release yet, trying to use this feature will result in an error:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tests in Testing Farm fail" src="/assets/images/testing_farm_failed-f53ec0611bf89aee0e9eedd30a992814.png" width="1091" height="786" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Test log in Testing Farm" src="/assets/images/testing_farm_failed_log-b4f3f67d4ae5d36021eda7ef2f9d0030.png" width="978" height="353" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As we can see in the screenshots, during artifact installation, the latest <code>specfile</code> release from Fedora was installed, however it lacks the feature that we are looking to test.
Let's now retrigger the tests, but specify that we want to install builds from the pull request in <code>specfile</code> which introduced the changes:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Retriggering tests with builds from another PR" src="/assets/images/testing_farm_retrigger-b67508e5263e2ee7f49b367670fcdd80.png" width="1095" height="727" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Hooray! The copr builds from PR 165 were installed before the tests were run in Testing Farm which enabled us to test the feature inside Packit CLI.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up<a href="#wrapping-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wrapping up" title="Direct link to Wrapping up">​</a></h3><p>We hope that this new feature makes upstream testing even more convenient than it previously was.
The feature is still quite new, and we would love to hear what you think about it.
As always, if you run into any trouble or have any ideas how to improve this functionality,
do not hesitate to <a href="/#contact">reach out to us</a>.
We will be happy to help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[As you may already know, for using Packit Service]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you may already know, for using Packit Service
GitHub App we <a href="/docs/guide#2-approval">require our users to have a valid Fedora Account System account</a>.
We were verifying the newcomers until now manually, but in recent weeks, we have implemented an automated solution
for it. Let's take a closer look at how it is done currently and what have we improved!</p><p>Formerly, the process of verification by us started by waiting for the users to provide
us their FAS username, then checking whether the provided FAS account
exists and matches, and finally, manually adding the account to our allowlist in the database. For the communication with
new users, we have used our <a href="https://github.com/packit/notifications/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>packit/notifications</code></a>
repository on GitHub where we created an issue for each new installation.</p><p>Although in general, this worked, it required human interaction and since we are not available 24/7, the verification wasn't immediate.
We wanted to simplify the process for both users and us.
Since in FAS, everyone can set their GitHub login that is then publicly available, we decided to utilize this setting.</p><p>So how does the verification work now?</p><p>For each new GitHub installation, we first check whether there isn't a FAS account with the same login as the one
that triggered the installation. If we find such an account, we check whether the <code>GitHub Username</code> in this FAS account matches
the GitHub login of the one that triggered the installation. To get the information about the FAS accounts, we
use the <a href="https://github.com/fedora-infra/fasjson-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>fasjson-client</code> library</a>.
If this check doesn't prove any match, we create an issue in the
<code>packit/notifications</code> repository as previously. This is what it looks like:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Issue in packit/notifications" src="/assets/images/notifications-repo-issue-aca66e4b420cfe5d05c205fcf0020f92.png" width="926" height="467" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As you can see, it contains instructions on how to trigger the verification automatically. So, everything the person who installed the app needs to do is set the <code>GitHub Username</code> field in their FAS account (if they don't have it set
already) and then provide the FAS login via Packit comment command <code>/packit verify-fas the-fas-account</code>.</p><p>Once the user does this, our service runs the same verification again (with the FAS username provided in the command) and informs users about the status
via a comment in the same issue. The successful verification looks like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Successful verification" src="/assets/images/verify-fas-355a7111420aea52229c20f33a86322c.png" width="932" height="397" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This should save both users and our time and hopefully make the onboarding process smoother for the newcomers.
Since this is a pretty new feature,
let us know whether there is something that is not clear so that we can improve it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally, it's here. Now, you can do the whole Fedora release with the help of Packit.

As a first step, the archive is saved to lookaside cache
and after that, Packit updates the dist-git content (mainly <code>sources</code> file and spec-file)
via pull-requests for the specified branches. (Direct push is possible only for CLI by setting a
<a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#create_pr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>create_pr</code> option</a> to <code>false</code>.)</p><p>If you use <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#copy_upstream_release_description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>copy_upstream_release_description: true</code></a>,
as in the config above,
the changelog entry will use the GitHub/GitLab release description field.
(Just make sure the formatting is compatible with spec-file.
E.g. use <code>-</code> instead of <code>*</code> for lists to not create multiple changelog entries.)</p><p>And how is it triggered?
Packit gets the information about the newly created release from GitHub/GitLab (via webhook),
loads the config from the release commit and if there is a <code>propose-downstream</code> job
defined, the workflow begins.</p><p>Here are the pull-requests created by Packit:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="List of downstream pull-requests created by Packit" src="/assets/images/distgit_prs-cf5788b3b23d52d771960621f308eab8.png" width="1089" height="420" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And here are the details of the one created for <code>f35</code> branch:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Downstream pull-request created by Packit" src="/assets/images/distgit_pr_detail-e34816e0dd354d7b35afc8131f517551.png" width="736" height="409" class="img_ev3q">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let's find out how Packit builds your SRPMs in the Copr.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h3><p>If you use Packit to build RPMs for your upstream code changes, likely,
you have already read about how does Packit build your <a href="http://ftp.rpm.org/max-rpm/s1-rpm-miscellania-srpms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SRPMs</a>.
If not, then just a short recap:
Each time an RPM build is triggered, Packit builds an SRPM and then submits
the created SRPM file to Copr where Copr takes care of building the actual RPMs.
Since you can modify the behaviour of building SRPMs by defining <a href="/docs/configuration/actions">actions</a>,
this process needs to be run in an isolated environment. For this, we implemented our
<a href="https://github.com/packit/sandcastle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sandboxing mechanism</a>,
which simply runs the provided commands in an Openshift pod freshly created for each build.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problems-of-the-previous-workflow-for-srpm-builds">Problems of the previous workflow for SRPM builds<a href="#problems-of-the-previous-workflow-for-srpm-builds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Problems of the previous workflow for SRPM builds" title="Direct link to Problems of the previous workflow for SRPM builds">​</a></h4><p>This is a pretty good-functioning workflow, but it has some downsides which have become more and more annoying
with the growing user base. Because of the resources, we have set limits for Openshift pods running at one time.
This directly affects how many SRPM builds can run in parallel. As a result, when there are too many requests for (S)RPM builds,
some can get stuck in the queue while waiting for other builds to finish. Another inconvenience coming with pods being
always freshly created is copying the needed data into
and from the pod. This has also cost us some months of desperate debugging of weird errors.
Another disadvantage is that users cannot easily configure dependencies for their actions run during building SRPMs.
We have to install the dependencies manually on-demand, but of course, which is not flexible.</p><p>We were thinking about improving the process for a long time but never reached any clear conclusion.
Then in one of our architecture meetings, when we tried to solve another
issue related to our sandboxing solution, Pavel Raiskup from Copr team asked us why didn't
we build the SRPMs directly in Copr. We knew that there is a way of building SRPMs in Copr,
but weren't aware of the details and how would this fit our use case.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementation-of-the-copr-srpms">Implementation of the Copr SRPMs<a href="#implementation-of-the-copr-srpms" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Implementation of the Copr SRPMs" title="Direct link to Implementation of the Copr SRPMs">​</a></h3><p>After some research of the <a href="https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/custom_source_method.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copr custom source method</a>, we
decided to give it a try. To make Copr build the SRPMs, Copr needs to be provided
with a script that will prepare the sources used to build an SRPM.
Therefore, we created the <code>packit prepare-sources</code> command, which mostly reuses existing code that is run also in the sandbox
workflow. It prepares the specfile, archive and other sources and then moves
them to a separate directory. So with the new implementation,
with each request to run (S)RPM build, Packit sends a dynamically created "script" to Copr that invokes our new command.
Here is what the script can look like:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">#!/bin/sh</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">git config --global user.email "hello@packit.dev"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">git config --global user.name "Packit"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">resultdir=$PWD</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">packit -d prepare-sources --result-dir "$resultdir" --pr-id 676 --job-config-index 2 https://github.com/packit/ogr</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>You can see that a pull request should be checked out or which job defined
in your Packit job config is the trigger of this action. And that's it! Copr finds the sources and builds SRPM from them.
Packit listens to the messages about the start and end of the build and similarily as for RPM builds, reports the
state via commit statuses/checks and provides the URL with the logs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deployment-phases">Deployment phases<a href="#deployment-phases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deployment phases" title="Direct link to Deployment phases">​</a></h3><p>Since this change is pretty significant, we wanted to start using this workflow gradually and catch all the problems
before we get rid of the previous workflow for SRPMs.
At first, we tested how does the new solution work in our projects. The only disadvantage
was that the actual build process
takes a little longer than in sandcastle as we get an isolated environment where all the packages are installed for each new build.
On the other hand, Copr usually starts the build very soon after it is submitted, so no long wait time until some other build is finished.
In the initial implementation, we installed a list of dependencies

sandbox which also increased the build time a bit.</p><p>So as the following step we added the functionality to define dependencies for actions in the

With this approach, anyone can configure
their dependencies and play with adding and adjusting them as needed without directly breaking
the builds in their repository. When the builds in the PR pass, the configuration change can be merged and the new approach
will be used for the whole repository. We wanted
to kick off this process and therefore started opening PRs with dependencies configuration for projects that use
the RPM builds functionality the most. During this phase, you can reach out to us with your feedback, so we can
improve it even more!</p><p>As a next step, we use the new approach for GitHub app installations made since September 6, 2022.</p><p>And as of January 10th 2023, we switched to building all SRPMs in Copr
and thus got rid of using our sandbox for building SRPMs entirely.</p><p>Since we don't want to break your CI results because of missing dependencies, we will use the previously linked list of deps.
As the list is pretty long, we encourage you to define your dependencies on your own. If you
bump into any troubles with setting up SRPM builds in Copr, please,
<a href="/#contact">reach out to us</a>, we will be glad to help!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The previous year 2021 wasn't interesting only because of the increased usage of Packit
(you can see more in <a href="/posts/2021-in-numbers">the previous post</a>).
The whole Packit team made a lot of improvements during the year.
Some small, some really big. So, let's take a look at the most important ones!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dashboard">Dashboard<a href="#dashboard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dashboard" title="Direct link to Dashboard">​</a></h2><p>The idea of having a dashboard for Packit service started as a
<a href="https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/gsoc-progress-report-dashboard-for-packit-july-1-aug-16-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Summer of Code 2020 project</a>
to provide a basic view of our service.
Thanks <a href="https://github.com/IceWreck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anchit</a> for starting this!
Nowadays, it's a core part of the project and it has replaced the result pages in plain HTML. Do you remember them?</p><p>The dashboard can be found at <a href="https://dashboard.packit.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard.packit.dev</a>.</p><p>Following picture shows a more convenient and visually-appealing view of builds and test runs.
For better context, the relevant pages are a connected to each other.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dashboard: Copr Build result" src="/assets/images/dashboard-copr-1a172fb72c00bb1b71af74610fc8ce7d.png" width="1085" height="776" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>If you want to see the overall picture, use our <a href="https://dashboard.packit.dev/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pipelines view</a> that was created exactly for that:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Dashboard: Pipelines view" src="/assets/images/dashboard-pipelines-03077187af2a61a8ab3a3fb1ed508d84.png" width="1304" height="721" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="future-of-the-dashboard">Future of the dashboard<a href="#future-of-the-dashboard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future of the dashboard" title="Direct link to Future of the dashboard">​</a></h3><p>We consider our dashboard an important part of our service and are working on or planning more improvements:</p><ul><li>We are working on personalised pages for a user or git-forge namespace.</li><li>We are planning to show info about other job types we support by the service as well;
especially the <code>propose-downstream</code> one.</li><li>We are doing some database schema updates to be able to better interconnect various pages.</li><li>Do you have an idea for an improvement?
Let us know by creating an issue <a href="https://github.com/packit/dashboard/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development">Development<a href="#development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development" title="Direct link to Development">​</a></h2><p>From the very start, Packit is developed publicly in an open-source way.
We participate in various projects like Google Summer of Code, Red Hat Open Source Contest and Hacktoberfest.
But we are also very glad if anyone from our users contributes and fixes some pain point.
To help with that, we've renamed all our branches to <code>main</code> and rapidly enhanced our contribution guide(s).
We would like to encourage you not to be afraid of contributing to any of <a href="https://github.com/packit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our projects</a>.
We are prepared to help you with that.</p><p>If you want to keep an eye on what we are currently working on, check our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/packit/projects/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Packit upstream work</em> board on GitHub</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GitHub: Packit upstream work" src="/assets/images/github-project-3606aa0b741a1835854a5cbfe59bcb15.png" width="1298" height="276" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-farm">Testing Farm<a href="#testing-farm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testing Farm" title="Direct link to Testing Farm">​</a></h2><p>The year 2021 was a tough one for our test workflow. For those who don't know, we use Testing Farm as our test runner.
At the beginning of the year, we switched to the new Testing Farm API version
(because the old one had died with the infrastructure it had been running on).
Unlike the old version, the new one fully supports <code>tmt</code> as a test definition.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Testing Farm: results" src="/assets/images/testing-farm-results-976b2fa2b8055708c9bca93336fdad33.png" width="1369" height="436" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>During the year, a set of supported environments was enhanced by <code>centos-6</code>, <code>oraclelinux</code> and <code>aarch64</code>.
For Red Hat teams, we added support for using the internal instance of the Testing Farm.
Let us know if you are interested in this.
But no worries, you can use <code>centos-stream</code> and other publicly available environments.</p><p>Originally, the tests were run after the installation of the packages built using Copr from the source repository.
Newly, you can skip this step and run the tests without any build. This allows you to use Packit&amp;TestingFarm
for repositories containing only test definitions (e.g. QE teams).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Testing Farm: no build" src="/assets/images/tf-no-build-9f7ecf53b820e6bfee6480256b97e69d.png" width="1309" height="194" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Lastly, we send some environment variables to the test environment and you can define your own if you want.</p><p>As we see, testing is a key feature for some teams and we still want to improve test use-cases
-- let us know if you are missing anything (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/testing-farm/-/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the Testing Farm issue tracker</a>).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="service">Service<a href="#service" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Service" title="Direct link to Service">​</a></h2><p>To get users quickly know that we accepted the task and started working on it, we added two nice features
-- <code>:1</code> reaction for the comment that we are reacting on and <code>task accepted</code> commit status.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Packit Service: reactions" src="/assets/images/thumbs-up-5f8d2df5d24049a4154408995c65dad3.png" width="950" height="176" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Speaking of statuses, we switched to a more feature-rich API called GitHub Check Runs.
It allows us to create a separate result page where we can show more information
-- e.g. more links when needed and more space for hints when there is a problem.
You can also find the run results on a separate <code>Checks</code> tab of the pull-requests page.
The check run page contains only the basic info and we don't want to replace a dashboard with this.
(Because of the consistency between git-forges and to be able to link the related dashboard pages.)
Another feature of check runs you might find useful is being able to re-run the failed test with just one click
(see the <code>Re-run</code> button in the following screenshot).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Check runs" src="/assets/images/check-runs-a38bf2a5d1febf4d3933a066dec2696c.png" width="977" height="384" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Inspired by other systems (like Zuul), for pull-requests we started using merge state
so you can be sure the state we use is the same as the one with the pull-request being merged.
We are working with the Testing Farm team to add the support there as well so the test definition is consistent with the build.
But no worries, you can disable this if you don't want this behaviour.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="downstream">Downstream<a href="#downstream" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Downstream" title="Direct link to Downstream">​</a></h2><p>One of our current initiatives is to help maintainers in the downstream part of the workflow as well.
We had the first part of that for some time in a form of <code>propose-downstream</code> job (you can expect more enhancements on this front),
but we newly support triggering Koji builds for new commits in dist-git.</p><p>When there is a new dist-git commit that contains Packit config with the defined <code>koji_build</code> job,
Packit will trigger the Koji build for you.
It's fresh and basic so far so give us some time to announce this with more details.
The next step will be to create a Bodhi update when the build successfully finishes and that is
what is currently being worked on.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="status-page">Status Page<a href="#status-page" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Status Page" title="Direct link to Status Page">​</a></h2><p>Yes, we have a status page where you can check if everything is ok with our service.
It can be found at <a href="https://status.packit.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">status.packit.dev</a>
On the page, you can find a list of incidents we resolved or are trying to fix.
If you don't see any incident and still think the service isn't working as expected, please,
let us know (see <a href="/#contact">contacts</a>).
Another useful source of information is the <a href="https://dashboard.packit.dev/pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pipelines view</a> on our dashboard.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Packit Status Page: systems" src="/assets/images/status-1-161f9f8eab1e1c68007141a99dfda890.png" width="575" height="652" class="img_ev3q">

And what you can expect this year?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let's take a look on the year 2021 through some numbers.
We would like to show you some interesting statistics and charts
that can describe the work of Packit during the year 2021.
If you are more interested in new features,
let's take a look on our <a href="/posts/2021-features">second post</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="github-application">GitHub Application<a href="#github-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to GitHub Application" title="Direct link to GitHub Application">​</a></h2><p>As of now, we have <code>169</code> installations of our GitHub application and <code>41</code> of them is from the year 2021.
Looking at the monthly numbers below, it looks like we are getting back to shape.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GitHub installations in 2021" src="/assets/images/github-installations-9dab680b453ba424a9fffa744270e432.png" width="350" height="210" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="builds">Builds<a href="#builds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Builds" title="Direct link to Builds">​</a></h2><p>Compared to the year 2020 when we made <code>28 430</code> Copr builds for our users,
we made <code>4.6</code> times more in the year 2021: <code>133 222</code> Copr builds.
For those who remember the start of our project,
we had a goal of <code>5</code> thousand for the <a href="https://flocktofedora.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLOCK</a> 2019.
We are now two digits ahead!
And if you are wondering how active is our user on Copr,
we've created <code>2/3</code> of all the new Copr projects during the year.</p><p>To made this happen, we've created <code>36 133</code> source RPM files in the year 2021.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Copr builds in 2021" src="/assets/images/copr-builds-dd34dfb527eb67affe3ddfad09436f25.png" width="362" height="211" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="test-runs">Test runs<a href="#test-runs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Test runs" title="Direct link to Test runs">​</a></h2><p>Sadly, we started saving the submit time of the test runs in June
so we have numbers only for the second half of the year.
The numbers are not so high as for the builds but still <code>18 498</code> test runs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Test runs in 2021" src="/assets/images/test-runs-e97a55c365a585076c678f29f29b3fd4.png" width="364" height="211" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-20-projects-in-the-number-of-pr-copr-builds">Top 20 projects in the number of PR Copr Builds<a href="#top-20-projects-in-the-number-of-pr-copr-builds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 20 projects in the number of PR Copr Builds" title="Direct link to Top 20 projects in the number of PR Copr Builds">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Top20 projects in the number of PR Copr Builds" src="/assets/images/top20-copr-builds-02b2a99641f6d7005a189512c9b1f7a0.png" width="639" height="377" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="top-20-projects-in-the-number-of-pr-test-runs">Top 20 projects in the number of PR test runs<a href="#top-20-projects-in-the-number-of-pr-test-runs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Top 20 projects in the number of PR test runs" title="Direct link to Top 20 projects in the number of PR test runs">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Top20 projects in the number of PR Test runs" src="/assets/images/top20-test-runs-a6d4a360be98fb3f66fb65f0d5a46be0.png" width="640" height="377" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content:encoded>

because one of build requirements was not available in ELN:</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Fedora ELN - Developmental modular packages for the next Enterprise Linux release               2.7 kB/s | 2.3 kB     00:0</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">No matching package to install: 'metacity'</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Not all dependencies satisfied</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">Error: Some packages could not be found.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>Since the team discovered this during their upstream development process, they
can react to the issue right away. It would have been pretty late if they found this
while the next major RHEL is reaching alpha - at this moment they should
have enough time to fix the problem and make sure anaconda builds fine in ELN.</p><p>So, are you convinced? Let us know if you need help setting up Packit in your
upstream repositories :)</p>]]></content:encoded>
