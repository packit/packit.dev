you to get commit hash of the HEAD of the target branch (i.e. base, where the changes are merged to).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/ogr/pull/671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit/ogr#671</a>)</li><li>Service now passes <code>PACKIT_TARGET_SHA</code> variable, which holds commit hash of the HEAD of the target
branch where the changes are supposed to be merged, to the Testing Farm environment. This should
help solving the issue of running tests from non-merged codebase on the Testing Farm side.

it&#x27;s not being merged with the target branch. This results into NVR of the

to test on in Testing Farm in the configuration. The checks for the
test job will also contain the name of the actual test distro
(and not the build target as previously).</li><li>A new option, <code>srpm_build_deps</code>, in the packit configuration file<br>can be used. Which is a list of RPM dependencies that are needed for
the actions to be run when building SRPM and is an indicator to build
the SRPMs in Copr.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="week-9-march-1st---march-7th">Week 9 (March 1st - March 7th)<a href="#week-9-march-1st---march-7th" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Week 9 (March 1st - March 7th)" title="Direct link to Week 9 (March 1st - March 7th)">​</a></h2><ul><li>When a specfile is being generated, and both <code>specfile_path</code> and
<code>downstream_package_name</code> are not set, Packit now correctly resolves this
situation and sets <code>specfile_path</code> to the name of the upstream repo suffixed
with <code>&quot;.spec&quot;</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1499</a>)</li><li>A new command <code>packit source-git status</code> has been introduced for checking
the synchronization of a source-git and a dist-git repository based on the
used git trailers. The command outputs a range of commits which need to be
synchronized from dist-git to source-git or the other way around. If possible,
the command also provides instructions on how to synchronize the repositories.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1500</a>)</li><li>We have added a new <code>enable_net</code> configuration option for Copr builds that
allows you to disable network access during Copr builds. It is also complemented
by <code>--enable-net</code>/<code>--disable-net</code> CLI options if you use Packit locally.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1504</a>)</li><li>Packit now adds 👀 instead of 👍 as a reaction to <code>/packit command</code>
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1372</a>)</li><li>Progress of propose-downstream is now saved in the database and is available
via API. Visualization in the dashboard is to follow next week, stay tuned.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1292</a>)</li><li>When running tests for the pull-request job, we now expose environment
variables for commit hash, branch and URL both for pull-request source and
target. In the test environment, you can use the following variables:

instances you want to use for working on your jobs. Nothing will change for our
production users, but users of our stage instance need to use this key to
preserve the support of the stage instance -- they can set both stg and prod in
the <code>packit_instances</code> list to use both, or use just one. Just be careful with
the downstream jobs where both instances work with the same services.
This new option works like other Packit options so you can set it on the top
level and/or (re)define it on the job level.

This functionality was introduced a while ago and was found to be not very beneficial in cases of differently
configured Copr jobs building in parallel in the same Copr repository. This is an implementation detail in the end,
but Copr project chroots are now only added and never subtracted

The <code>build</code> job type name has been deprecated. It aimed to be an alias when Packit supported just one build type.
There are currently more types of builds and just <code>build</code> can be misleading. Please, be explicit and use <code>copr_build</code> instead.
The <code>production_build</code> name for upstream Koji build is misleading because it is not used to run production/non-scratch
builds and because it can be confused with the <code>koji_build</code> job that is triggered for dist-git commits.
(The <code>koji_build</code> job can trigger both scratch and non-scratch/production builds.)
To be explicit, use <code>upstream_koji_build</code> for builds triggered in upstream and <code>koji_build</code> for builds triggered in downstream.
Users will get a neutral status describing the change when the old names are in use. The status will become a warning
starting in November and the old names will be removed by the end of the year.

source specified by <code>spec_source_id</code> (whether remote or not) to lookaside. Previously, only Source0
was uploaded. Source0 is no longer treated specially, but as <code>spec_source_id</code> is <code>Source0</code> by default,
Source0 is still being uploaded by default unless <code>spec_source_id</code> is overriden.

There is a new method, <code>Specfile.get_active_macros()</code>, to get active macros in the context of the spec file.
The underlying <code>rpm.spec</code> instance is now exposed as <code>Specfile.rpm_spec</code> property.
There is a new utility class for parsing NEVRA strings.

updates for builds that are not yet tagged properly. CLI exprience was also
improved for this case.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1803</a>)</li><li>Packit now resets the <code>Release</code> tag during <code>propose-downstream</code> if the version
is updated and the <code>Release</code> tag has not explicitly been overridden in the
upstream specfile.

should use <code>srpm_build_deps</code> to be sure that we don&#x27;t break your workflow once
we switch to building all SRPMs in Copr in January.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1804</a>)</li><li>We&#x27;ve increased internal task retry backoff time in Packit GitHub app from 3 to
7 seconds. We hope this will increase success for network flakes and <em>random</em>
infrastructure issues. Creation of bodhi updates should be now more reliable too
as Packit will try more times (from 2 to 5).
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1800</a>)</li><li>Tags enclosed in conditional macro expansions are not ignored anymore.

and combined together (with one exception - <code>Specfile.macro_definitions()</code>), and
it is also possible to use tag properties (e.g. <code>Specfile.version</code>, <code>Specfile.license</code>)
inside them. It is also possible to access the data directly, avoiding the <code>with</code>
statement, by using the <code>content</code> property (e.g. <code>Specfile.tags().content</code>), but
be aware that no modifications done to such data will be preserved. You must use
<code>with</code> to make changes.
