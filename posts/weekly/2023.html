getting 50x response from the Pagure API. This should increase usability as
those tasks will be retried.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/ogr/pull/762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ogr#762</a>)</li><li>Packit now puts the correct release number into the changelog when the

Testing Farm runs that do not require any Copr build.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/dashboard/pull/200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dashboard#200</a>)</li><li>All classes including <code>Specfile</code> itself can now be copied using the standard

(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1826</a>)</li><li>We have fixed a bug which caused long Copr build end reporting time on a few occurrences. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1838</a>)</li><li>A few fixes has been implemented to make it possible to use <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#propose_downstream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>propose-downstream</code> job</a> on GitLab.

and <code>/packit koji-update</code> comments in an issue opened by Packit in the configured <code>issue_repository</code> if anything
went wrong during these jobs. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1796</a>)</li><li>All Copr projects created by Packit now default to <code>enable_net=False</code>: our documentation stated this, but it
wasn&#x27;t the case. This is now corrected. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1825</a>)</li><li>You can now specify <code>update_release: false</code> in the configuration to tell Packit not to change the Version and
Release in the spec file. It works the same as <code>--no-update-release</code> (renamed from now deprecated <code>--no-bump</code>) in
the CLI. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1827" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1827</a>)</li><li>Packit now supports setting <code>module_hotfixes</code> for Copr projects.
(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1829</a>)</li><li>Packit now also allows passing in free-form parameters to Testing Farm in order to support all of its
options immediately once they are added. The parameters can be passed through the <code>tf_extra_params</code> config option.
The free-form dictionary must follow the structure of Testing Farm POST requests. See <a href="https://packit.dev/docs/testing-farm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our documentation</a>
and examples for more information. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1853</a>)</li><li>Fixed a bug in section parsing that caused sections to be ignored when there were macro definitions spread
across the spec file and not cumulated at the top. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/specfile/pull/191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specfile#191</a>)</li><li>Also fixed the infinite loop that occurred when section options were followed by whitespace.

(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit-service#1881</a>)</li><li>Packit now groups related builds and test runs (e.g. triggered by the same event, just different chroots) together. In the future, this will allow better presentation of the overall pipelines (e.g. in the dashboard). We now also create database entries before sending requests to external service (e.g. Testing Farm), therefore failures will be more visible in the dashboard.

(<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1857</a>)</li><li>Packit does fewer API calls when searching for the package configuration file in remote repositories. (<a href="https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">packit#1846</a>)</li><li>Commit statuses/check names will now contain the name of the branch or release for the build and test jobs with <code>commit</code> or <code>release</code> trigger.
This will prevent the collision of the names.
