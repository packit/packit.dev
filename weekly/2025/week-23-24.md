## Week 23-24 (June 3rd â€“ June 16th)

- Team was attending and presenting at [Flock to Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/flock/2025/) and
  [Devconf.cz](https://www.devconf.info/cz/) conferences. The highlight for us was connecting with so many Packit users in person!
  We want to thank everyone who attended our sessions and shared their feedback. If you are curious, here is the list of sessions we held:
  - [Even more release automation talk](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/VZETQA/)
  - [What about a better dist-git CI?](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/TNVBXQ/)
  - [specfile library + norpm](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/CLDGTL/)
  - [Smarter package maintenance with Packit (workshop)](https://cfp.fedoraproject.org/flock-to-fedora-2025/talk/JBYMTX/)
  - [Kanban, our way](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/TLPB3M/)
  - [Breaking Changes Without Breaking Users: Lessons from Packit 1.0](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/UTGBCF/)
  - [Breaking Barriers: Cross-Distro CI/CD with Packit and OBS](https://pretalx.devconf.info/devconf-cz-2025/talk/7DESJP/)
- Packit now exposes `specfile_path` from configuration (or its default value) as the environment variable `PACKIT_SPECFILE_PATH` for all Packit actions. ([`packit#2589`](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/2589))
