## Week 50 (December 10th – December 16th)

- As the next step in Packit integration with Log Detective, Packit Service is now able to handle fedmsg messages from Log Detective (`logdetective.analysis` topic) containing state of analysis of failed build logs. ([packit-service#2900](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2900))
