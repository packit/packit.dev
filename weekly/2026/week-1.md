## Week 1 (January 1st – January 5th)

- For retriggering tests with builds from another pull request, Packit now supports
  Github's automatically converted URL format (`https://github.com/namespace/repo/pull/<pr_id>`,
  e.g. `/packit test https://github.com/namespace/repo/pull/<pr_id>`)
  ([packit-service#2923](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2923))
