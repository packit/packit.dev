## Week 2 (January 6th – January 12th)

- Previously, statuses were updated after a related build status update, even for PR-triggered test jobs whose label requirements didn't match the PR. This has been changed to help avoid Github API rate limiting. ([packit-service#2928](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/2928))
